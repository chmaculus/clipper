^b Major Syntax Changes

 Various changes are made in new versions of Frankie.  Those specifically
 mentioned in this section are those that may require modifications in your
 application's source.  The following notes will serve as a guide in
 implementing such modifications.

^b Version 3.00 to 3.10

 1. In v3.00, ADini_load() erroneously created the .ini file if it did not
    exist.  In v3.10, this is no longer the case.  If you had relied on
    ADini_load() to create your .ini file, you may have to change your code.

    Change your code from:

      ADini_load( nEngine, "my.ini" )

    to:

      if !file( "my.ini" )
          fclose( fcreate( "my.ini" ) )
      endif

      ADini_load( nEngine, "my.ini" )

^b Version 2.30 to 3.00

 1. &-embedding, to indicate menu item trigger position, was implemented.
    If your menu item contains an '&', it will be mis-interpreted as a
    trigger position indicator.  You will need to change it.

^b Version 2.2x to 2.3x

 None

^b Version 2.1 to 2.2

 1. ADbm_isprinter().  Support for LPT ports other than the default LPT1
    was added in v2.2.  The syntax changed from:

    ADbm_isprinter( [bConfig], [cHelpID] )

    to:

    ADbm_isprinter( [nPrinter], [bConfig], [cHelpID] )

    where [nPrinter] is 1 for LPT1, 2 for LPT2 and 3 for LPT3, but defaults
    to 1.

    You may have to modify your existing source code as follows:

    1.  Old: ADbm_isprinter()
        New: Same or ADbm_isprinter(1)

    2.  Old: ADbm_isprinter( bConfig )
        New: ADbm_isprinter( , bConfig ) or ADbm_isprinter( 1, bConfig )

    3.  Old: ADbm_isprinter( , cHelpID )
        New: ADbm_isprinter( ,, cHelpID ) or ADbm_isprinter( 1,, cHelpID )

    4.  Old: ADbm_isprinter( bConfig, cHelpID )
        New: ADbm_isprinter( , bConfig, cHelpID )
          or ADbm_isprinter( 1, bConfig, cHelpID )

 2. ADdb_seek().  Added 4th and 5th parameters, [cPicture] and [lSoftSeek],
    and inserted them just before [cHelpID] which used to be the
    third and last parameter (Now it is the 5th and still the last).

 3. ADdb_columns().  The meaning of this function has been totally changed.
    If you use this API, replace all ADdb_columns() calls with ADdb_fields()
    all ADdb_adget() with ADdb_colget(), and all ADdb_fldread() with
    ADdb_colread().  See DB_COLUM.TXT for more details.

 4. ADhormenu().  Now the Esc key and the right mouse button are active by
    default.  They used to be not active.


^bVersion 2.0 to 2.1

 Some changes from v2.1 to v2.2 require modifications in your application's
 source.  The following notes will serve as a guide in implementing such
 modifications.

 1. ADr_tbpopup().  In v2.0 only the top/left corner of the popup box could
    be specified.  In v2.1, all four corners can be specified.  This was
    accomplished by changing the meanings of the first two parameters. Please
    refer to the detailed documentation of ADr_tbpopup() for a complete
    description of this change.  You might have to modify your existing code
    as follows:

    1.  Old: ADr_tbpopup( NIL, NIL, .. )
        New: No change

    2.  Old: ADr_tbpopup( nRow, nCol, .. )
        New: ADr_tbpopup( { nRow, nCol, Nil, NIL }, NIL, .. )

    3.  Old: ADr_tbpopup( nRow, NIL, .. )
        New: ADr_tbpopup( { nRow, NIL, Nil, NIL }, NIL, .. )

    4.  Old: ADr_tbpopup( NIL, nCol, .. )
        New: ADr_tbpopup( { NIL, nCol, Nil, NIL }, NIL, .. )


^b Version 2.0

 Some changes from v1 to v2 require modifications in your application's
 source.  The following notes will serve as a guide in implementing such
 modifications.

 1.  Frankie v1 was compiled in Clipper 5.2.  If you are still using
     Clipper 5.01, you need to do the following:

     #include F2_501.CH in your programs.  Its correct placement is "before"
     FRANKIE.CH, like this:

        #include F2_501.CH
        #include FRANKIE.CH

     If you do not properly #include F2_501.CH, the mouse will not work
     with ADread(), which is the Frankie replacement of the GetSys.Prg.

     Also link F2_501.LIB, together with, but ahead of FRANKIE.LIB.
     Your link command may look like this:

        blinker file MYFILE lib F2_501, FRANKIE

     or:

        rtlink  file MYFILE lib F2_501, FRANKIE

     If you do not properly link F2_501.LIB, you may get "undefined symbols"
     warnings during linking, and the resulting .exe file may not work
     properly.  However, if "CLIPPER520" is the only undefined symbol
     encountered, you need not worry about it.

     See F_TOUR.CH, F_TOUR.LNK, and F_TOURR.LNK for examples.

 2.  The ADMEMO extension of ADGET is no longer supported in this version.
     Refer to the ADread() documentation for instructions on how to modify
     existing code.  Basically, it is simply a change from:

        @ .. SAY .. ADMEMO ..

     to:

        @ .. SAY .. ADGET .. MEMO

 3.  If you used the ADsbx_.. and the ADsby.. functions, you will have to
     rewrite the source portions that call them.  Please refer to the
     documentation of the Horizontal Scroll Bar Engine and the Vertical
     Scroll Bar Engine.  If you used them only in implementing scroll bars
     in the database browsers, then you only need to remove all the ADsby..
     and ADsbx.. lines and configure the browser with the ADdb_horsbar()
     and ADdb_versbar() APIs.  Refer to the Database Browser Engine
     documentation.

 4.  The default location of a vertical menu has been changed from the
     top/left corner of the screen to the center of the screen.  Thus if you
     have an ADvermenu() call like this:

        ADvermenu( ,, aMenu )

     the menu will now be centered, instead of being placed at the top left
     corner.  If you want to preserve the location of "default" menus in
     existing applications, modify these menu calls to :

        ADvermenu( 0,0, aMenu )

 5. In Frankie 1, the menu wraps from the first to the last option when the
    up arrow is pressed, and vice-versa.  In Frankie 2, this wrap behavior
    has to be explicitly configured in one-page menus, otherwise, no such
    wrapping occurs.  The rewrite may take this form:

        Original:  ADvermenu( ,, aMenu )
        Rewrite:   ADvermenu( ,, aMenu,,, {|| ADvm_wrap(.t.)} )

    In multi-page picklists, ADvermenu() always wraps.

 6. In Frankie 1, ADbm_exit() was used to abort ADboxmenu().  In Frankie 2
    ADbm_exit() no longer exists.  It has been replaced with ADbm_abort().
