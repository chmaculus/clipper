 The Frankie package contains several illustrative and instructional
 examples.  This section describes how to run them.  It is assumed that the
 Frankie package was installed in \frankie, and that your LIB and INCLUDE
 environmental variables are properly set.

 F_TOUR.PRG - this is a demo of the major features of Frankie.  To compile
              and link the program, use any of the following batch files
              located in the \frankie\tour directory:

              cbfrank.bat - if you link with Blinker 2.x and earlier
              cpfrank.bat - if you link with Blinker 3.x and later
              crfrank.bat - if you link with RTlink
              cefrank.bat - if you link with Exospace
              ccfrank.bat - if you link with Causeway

 Early demos - these are found in \frankie\tour\sample.  Use any of these
              batch files, located in the same directory, to compile/link:

              cb.bat - if you use Blinker
              cr.bat - if you use RTlink

 New demos - these are located in \frankie\tour\newdemo.  Use the same
              batch files as in 'Early demos'

 User contributed demos - these are located in \frankie\tour\userdemo.  Use
