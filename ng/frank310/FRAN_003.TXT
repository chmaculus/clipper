^b Bug Reports


 This product has undergone extensive testing, but errors in the software
 and/or documentation may be discovered.

 If you find a problem, please report it to us instead of just letting it
 slide or working around it.  We will do our best to get it resolved
 quickly.

 Resolution of reported problems takes first priority in our shop.  This
 process, however, may be delayed because of incomplete information.

 When reporting a problem please include the following information:

 1.  A trimmed down example (source code) that has been pre-tested to
     compile and link cleanly.

 2.  Compiling/linking instructions.  A batch file or a make file is
     appropriate.

 3.  A small database if one is used by the program.

 4.  Step by step instructions on how to produce the problem. (Keys to
     press, mouse buttons to click, etc.)

 If the problem is not easily reproducible with a trimmed down example,
 please describe it in as much detail as you feel necessary.
