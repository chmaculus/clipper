     ^bImportant! ^b Some of the topics in this guide are intended for
     advanced CA-Clipper developers.  Much of this information is presented
     at a fairly high level and requires programming knowledge beyond the
     CA-Clipper language.  Other parts are useful to users of all levels.
     Refer to the "User Interface Levels" section of the Replaceable Database
     Driver Architecture chapter to determine which part of the language is
     appropriate to your level of expertise.

     Based on your own experience level with the CA-Clipper language, you
     should decide whether you wish to take advantage of these new and
     advanced features.  The Reference guide contains existing CA-Clipper
     command and function syntax and descriptions.  This guide addresses new
     extensions to CA-Clipper.  Understanding this information should enable
     you to increase the power and effectiveness of your applications.

     CA-Clipper 5.2 supports a driver architecture that allows CA-Clipper-
     compiled applications to use replaceable database and terminal drivers.
     This Drivers guide contains all the information you need to use the
     replaceable drivers provided as part of the CA-Clipper Development
     System.

'------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 ^bOverview of RDD System^b
컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

     RDD is an abbreviation for Replaceable Database Driver, and it is used
     to describe an interface that controls how your application accesses and
     manipulates database and ancillary files.

     CA-Clipper provides several RDDs to give you access to the database,
     memo, and index file formats of many popular database software products.
     By simply linking the proper RDD with your application, you get
     automatic, easy access to files created by other database engines.

     Moreover, CA-Clipper gives you new and enhanced commands and functions
     designed to make your applications independent of the RDD in use.  Using
     RDDs, you can give end users more flexibility in choosing to migrate to
     your CA-Clipper applications without losing data and to easily move
     their data back and forth between applications if they prefer.

 ^bOverview of Alternate Terminal Drivers^b
컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

     An Alternate Terminal Driver is a library file (.LIB) that controls how
     your application addresses the screen output device.  CA-Clipper
     provides several Alternate Terminal Drivers to allow your applications
     to run in a wider variety of environments.

     ^bNote:^b  To perform normal information presented in screen
     input/output in a CA-Clipper application, you do not need the Drivers
     guide.  The default database and terminal drivers are automatically
     linked and the commands and functions used for these purposes are
     discussed in the Reference guide.  For several categorized lists of
     these commands and functions, refer to Appendix G: Categorized Language
     Tables in the Error Messages and Appendices guide.

     The CA-Clipper database system supports a driver architecture that makes
     CA-Clipper-compiled applications data format independent.  Such
     applications can, therefore, access the data formats of other database
     systems, including the dBASE IV (.mdx), FoxPro (.cdx), and Paradox (.db)
     formats on a variety of equipment.  This chapter discusses how RDDs fit
     into the overall CA-Clipper architecture, defines the basic terminology
     you will need to understand subsequent chapters, and summarizes new and
     enhanced commands and functions designed to support the RDD
     architecture.

     CA-Clipper 5.2 provides many new and enhanced commands and functions
     that you will use to access and manipulate databases and to get specific
     information about the RDD in use.  This chapter contains entries for all
     new CA-Clipper commands and functions designed for use with RDDs.  As
     for existing language elements, only those that were changed to
     accommodate the new RDD architecture are documented here.  Other
     language elements that are specifically designed for database
     manipulation and have not been altered (e.g., USE) are documented in the
     Reference guide.
