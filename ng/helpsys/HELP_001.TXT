     This product is being released as a ^bShareware product^b.  This
means that the shareware version of the program may be freely copied
and evaluated by anyone.  If you decide that this product will suit
your needs, simply send a ^b$30.00 donation^b to us and we will send you a
more powerful version of the software that lets you have more control.
Also included will be several functions that allow window
manipulation, printing, database and video stack saving.  These will
be documented and include sample programs on usage.

     Send an additional ^b$10.00 for FULL Source Code^b.

     ^bPlease add $5.00 for outside of USA^b.
     
     This HelpSys module was designed for quick and easy help screens
without adding a single line of code to your Clipper 5.01 or Clipper
5.2 application.  Simply link in the object file, include the
HELPSYS2.LIB file.  That's all there is to it. You'll have field level
help with out much work or effort on your part.  Enter your help while
running your application!  No field names or screens to memorize!

     Also included in this package is a networking module that makes
networking tasks easier to manage.  Several other functions are
currently being prepared to add to this library.  The concept here is
that when you register for the HelpSys2 product, you'll automatically
be registered for the other products that make their way into this
library.  When obtaining Source Code for HelpSys 2.x you receive
source code for all libraries included.

     The Shareware version does NOT contain some of the help control
modules and window printing modules.  This version is also slightly
crippled, when pressing F1 to invoke the help screen(s), you can only
bring up the help screens a total of 10 times per application
execution.  This should be more than sufficient for your testing.
Also, upon registering, for an ^badditional $10.00^b I will send you full
^bSource Code^b that you can modify as needed.  I know that when
developing, I always feel more comfortable about my application when
using libraries that I have control over.  You will not be allowed to
distribute the source code or object code for the registered version
of this software.

^b     The majority of these functions are FULLY functional, no anoying^b
^bmessages or restrictions.  You can test these functions in your programs^b
^bfor a period of 30 days.  After that you are required to register this^b
^bsoftware.^b

^r     Registered users of HelpSys 1.1 can upgrade for the difference    ^r
^rprice ($10.00).  Also, upon registering, if you've received source     ^r
^rcode for HelpSys 1.1, you will also receive source code for 2.x for no ^r
^radditional cost to you.                                                ^r

!short: Why should I register?
'------------------------------------------------------------------------------
^bWhy should I register?^b

     I feel that after all this work and effort, ^b$30.00^b is a minimal
charge for providing such capabilities (+ ^b$10.00^b if you want the
source code).  There are several other routines that I've written over
the past several years that I'll plan on releasing as Shareware
(including software security routines).  This is to everyone’s
advantage.  Upon registering, you'll be registered for Network and
other libraries that migrate their way into the HelpSys 2.x series.

     Upon registering, you'll have the right to distribute an unlimited
number of copies of your programs that contain HelpSys.  You are not 
allowed to distribute Source, Object and Library files of HelpSys.  If
your product includes HelpSys routines, it is not allowed to compete with
this HelpSys product.

^b[For International Orders, please include and additional $5.00 US^b
^bFunds for shipping outside USA]^b

     When registering, please provide me with your Compuserve or
Internet account name or address if you have one.  This will allow me
to send minor updates free (other than CIS, Internet or postage
charges).

!short: Running the Demonstration Program
'------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     The demonstration program for allowing you to quickly see a little
of what HelpSys is all about is just a few lines of code.  If you look
at the source, you'll see nothing special about it at all.  You could
just as easily add HelpSys to your application with no real effort.

There are two key programs in the /SAMPLES directory
      ^bMAKETEST.PRG^b     Make test databases with test data
      ^bHELPTEST.PRG^b     Entry screen for test data, press F1 when
                       running.

     Compile these with the /n switch and link them to helpsys2.
     
^r     RTLINK FILE MAKETEST,HELPSYS2 LIB HELPSYS2                       ^r
^r     or what ever linker your using.  NOTE:  Use HelpSys1 when using  ^r
^r     Clipper 5.01.                                                    ^r

     Run the MAKETEST program first to create the test data and proceed
with HELPTEST.  You can then press F1 while running the test program so
you can see the results.  If your running in a network situation, use
the ^bHELPNET.PRG^b in place of the HELPTEST program.

!short: QuickStart
'------------------------------------------------------------------------------
              HelpSys 2.0x - For the Developer

     Initially you will need to tell HelpSys 2.0 that you are a
developer.  You can do this by setting the environment variable
HELPMODE to any value at the command prompt.

     i.e.

     ^bSET HELPMODE=DEVELOPER^b

^r      When starting from scratch on a help database, you will need a  ^r
^r HelpSys database created for you.  This is done automatically when   ^r
^r invoking HelpSys 2.xx AND in DEVELOPER MODE.                         ^r

     Once this has been entered and HelpSys2 is invoked from your
application (via the F1 key) you will see a message appear in the
upper left corner of the screen [Developer Mode].  This enables you to
press F1 anytime you want to edit existing help or create additional
help screens.  When a new help screen is created, you will be notified
via an alert.  You can then edit the help (or blank help window) and
press ESC when done.  It will automatically be saved at that point.

     The F2 key is available to toggle between Developer mode and User
mode while developing your application level help.  In other words,
when HELPSYS is invoked AND HELPMODE has been set the F2 key becomes
active.  When in Developer mode, you can add Help Screens.  When in
the User mode, when no more help is available, a Help Topics list will
automatically appear or all available help.  Also, since the HELPMODE
was defined you can delete unwanted Help Screens by pressing the DEL
key on the highlighted help topic and confirming the 'Are you sure you
want to delete this entry?' question.

     The Help Topics list will appear when no help is available while
HELPMODE has not been assigned (no deleting will be allowed if
HELPMODE is not defined) or while in User mode.  The help topic is
ALWAYS the FIRST LINE IN THE HELP SCREEN.

Program Notes:

     When Linking include HELPSYS2.OBJ with your program and include
HELPSYS2.LIB
^b[NOTE: If your using Clipper 5.01 use the HELPSYS1.OBJ and HELPSYS1.LIB^b
^b       files instead of HELPSYS2.xxx]^b

^r RTLINK FILE TEST.OBJ,HELPSYS2.OBJ LIB HELPSYS2  ^r
^r     or                                          ^r

Using index or memo file formats other than .NTX or .DBT

     ^bHelpSys 2.xx does not have any hardcoded database or index
^bextensions.^b  This means that you can use any CLIPPER RDD compliant
product.  HelpSys 2.xx has been tested with FLEXFILE II and COMIX.

     The beginning code segment in the main application looked like
the following:
