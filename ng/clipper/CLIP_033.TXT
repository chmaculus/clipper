^BREPLACE^B

    REPLACE changes the contents of specified fields in the active database
    file.

^USyntax^U

    REPLACE [<scope>] [<alias>->]<field1> WITH <exp1>
    [,<field2> WITH <exp2>...] [FOR <condition>] [WHILE <condition>]

^UArguments^U

    <field> is the name of the target field to change.  This can be a field
    of any type including memo.  There is one target field per WITH clause.

    <exp> is the replacement expression.

^UOptions^U

    ^BAlias^B: Fields in other work areas can be REPLACEd by preceding the
    field name with the alias.

    ^BScope^B: The <scope> is the portion of the current database file to
    REPLACE.  The default is the current record.  If a condition is
    specified the scope becomes ALL.

    ^BCondition^B: The FOR clause specifies the conditional set of records
    to REPLACE within the given scope.  The WHILE clause specifies the set
    of records meeting the condition from the current record until the
    condition fails.

^UUsage^U

    The field and the WITH expression must have the same data type.  With
    numeric fields, the WITH expression may not be larger than the field
    width.  If it is, asterisks replace the field contents, and some data
    may be lost.

^UIndexed Files^U

    Replacements on a key field of an indexed database file also update the
    index file if it is in use.  When the replacement is made, the record
    moves to a new position in the index file.  If you specify a scope,
    WHILE, or FOR when making replacements on an indexed field, not all of
    the records you intended will be replaced.  For example, if you REPLACE
    ALL, only the first record and those that follow the new key field
    value will be replaced.  That's because each record is reindexed as the
    REPLACE is done, and the record pointer is moved to follow the replaced
    record.  To REPLACE all the records, you should use the database file
    without an index, and then REINDEX afterwards.

^UMemo Fields^U

    Since Clipper supports the manipulation of memo fields in the same way
    as character fields, you can REPLACE a memo field with a character
    string.

^UNetwork^U

    In a network environment, REPLACE requires the current record be locked
    with RLOCK() if you are REPLACEing a single record; the current
    database file be locked with FLOCK() or USEd EXCLUSIVEly, if you are
    REPLACEing several records.  If a field is being REPLACEd in an
    unselected work area, that record must also be locked with FLOCK().
