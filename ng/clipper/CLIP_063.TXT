^BSET INDEX^B

    SET INDEX opens the specified index files in the current work area.

^USyntax^U

    SET INDEX TO [<file list>/(<expC1>)...]

^UArgument^U

    <file list> are the names of one or more (up to 15) index (.ntx or
    .ndx) files to open in the current work area, separated by commas.

^UUsage^U

    SET INDEX assumes an .ntx or .ndx filename extension unless otherwise
    specified.  You may include a drive letter and/or path name with the
    index filename.

    CLOSE INDEX or SET INDEX TO without a filename closes all indexes open
    in the current work area.

    When more than one index file is opened for the active database file,
    the first index becomes the controlling index.  The record pointer is
    then positioned at the first logical record in the index.  During
    database file processing, all open indexes are updated whenever a key
    value is appended or changed.  To change the controlling index without
    issuing another SET INDEX command, use SET ORDER.

    ^BMacro Variables^B: Index files may be specified by using macro
    variables.  Each file listed, however, must be a separate variable.
    For example, this is not permissible:

    ^Rntx_list = "Name, Account"^R
    ^RSET INDEX TO &ntx_list    ^R

    Note that macros substituting a null string ("") or spaces are ignored.
