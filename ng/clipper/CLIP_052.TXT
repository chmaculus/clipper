^BSET DEFAULT^B

    SET DEFAULT TO allows you to select the drive where all operations
    take place and all files are stored, unless otherwise directed.

^USyntax^U

    SET DEFAULT TO <drive>[:<path>]

^UArguments^U

    <drive> identifies a disk drive name or letter.

    <path> identifies the directory that you want to make the default.  If
    you specify both a drive and directory, a colon must be included after
    the drive letter.

    SET DEFAULT TO without an argument defaults to the last directory used
    on the designated drive.

^UUsage^U

    The default drive and directory are those where your Clipper
    application is initially started.  Once in the application, you can
    change this with SET DEFAULT.

    Note that the default drive and directory do not constitute the search
    path for accessing files.  To set a search path for file access, use
    SET PATH.  SET DEFAULT is used primarily to specify the location where
    new files are written.

    Note also that SET DEFAULT does not change the DOS drive and directory.
    Executing a RUN accesses the last drive and directory set in DOS.
