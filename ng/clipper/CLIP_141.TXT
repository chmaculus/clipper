^BSTRTRAN()^B

    STRTRAN() searches and replaces within a character string.

^USyntax^U

    STRTRAN(<expC1>,<expC2>[,<expC3>] [,<expN1>] [,<expN2>})

^UArguments^U

    <expC1> is the character string to search.

    <expC2> is the sequence of characters to locate.

    <expC3> is the sequence of characters to replace with.  If this
    argument is not specified, all instances of the search argument are
    replaced with a null string ("").

    <expN1> is the first occurrence that will be replace.  If this
    argument is omitted, the default is one.

    <expN2> is the number of occurrences to replace.  If this argument is
    not specified, the default is all.

^UReturns^U

    A character string.

^UUsage^U

    STRTRAN() performs a standard substring search within a character
    string.  When it finds a match, it replaces the search string with the
    specified replacement string.  All instances of the search string are
    replaced.

    Note that STRTRAN() replaces substrings and therefore does not account
    for whole words.  Additionally, SET EXACT ON has no effect on its
    operation.  STRTRAN() always acts as if SET EXACT is OFF.
