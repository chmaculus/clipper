^BSET FILTER^B

    SET FILTER allows display of only those records of a database file that
    meet a specified condition.

^USyntax^U

    SET FILTER TO [<condition>]

^UUsage^U

    SET FILTER applies only to the database file open in the work area
    where the command is issued.  Therefore, a different filter condition
    may be set for each open database file.

    SET FILTER TO <condition> sets up a filter based on a valid expression.
    The condition can filter records in the active database file based on
    any of the allowed data types, for example, on a character field (SET
    FILTER TO Lastname='Smith') or on a date filed (SET FILTER TO
    Department=CTOD('12/25/85').

    Filters are not activated until ^Bafter^B the record pointer is moved
    within a file.  This means that your filter condition is not in effect
    unless something has caused the pointer to change position since the
    condition was set.  The best way to assure that a filter is in effect
    is to execute a GOTO TOP command after setting the filter.

    As with SET DELETED, a filter has no effect on INDEX and REINDEX.  You
    may, however, directly access filtered records with GOTO or commands
    using the RECORD scope.
