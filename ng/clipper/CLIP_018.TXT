^BLIST^B

    To LIST the result of one or more expressions for each record
    processed.

^USyntax^U

    LIST [OFF] [<scope>] <exp list> [FOR <condition>]
    [WHILE <condition>] [TO PRINT] [TO FILE <file>/(<expC>)]

^UArgument^U

    <exp list> is the list of values displayed for each record processed.

^UOptions^U

    ^BScope^B: The <scope> is the portion of the current database file to
    LIST.  The default is the current record.  If a condition is specified
    the scope becomes ALL.

    ^BCondition^B: The FOR clause specifies the conditional set of records
    to LIST within the given scope.  The WHILE clause specifies the set of
    records meeting the condition from the current record until the
    condition fails.

    ^BOff^B: The OFF clause suppresses the display of the record number.

    ^BPrint^B: The TO PRINT clause echoes output to the printer.

    ^BFile^B: The TO FILE clause echoes output to the specified filename.
    If an extension is not specified, (.txt) is added.

^UUsage^U

    LIST sends the results of the <exp list> to the screen in a tabular
    format, each column separated by a space.  LIST is identical to DISPLAY
    with the exception that its default scope is ALL rather than NEXT 1.

^UExamples^U

    One of the unique uses for LIST in Clipper is to provide the record
    movement, scope, condition, and end-of-file boundary tests for a
    procedure that traverses a database file.  The procedure itself only
    processes the current record.  In the example below, Report() operates
    only on the current record:

    ^RUSE Sales                         ^R
    ^RSET DEVICE TO PRINT               ^R
    ^RLIST Report() FOR Branch = "100"  ^R
    ^RSET DEVICE TO SCREEN              ^R
    ^R                                  ^R
    ^RFUNCTION Report                   ^R
    ^R@ PROW() + 1, 3 SAY Branch        ^R
    ^R@ PROW() + 1, COL() + 1 SAY Branch^R
    ^R@ PROW() + 1, COL() + 1 SAY Amount^R
    ^RRETURN ""                         ^R

    To interrupt a LIST, use INKEY() as a part of the condition such as:

    ^RDISPLAY Branch, Salesman, Amount FOR INKEY() <> 27^R
