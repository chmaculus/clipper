    KEYBOARD stuffs the keyboard input buffer with the given string.  Each
    execution of KEYBOARD flushes the type-ahead buffer.  Multiple keyboard
    commands cannot be used to queue multiple strings.  However, KEYBOARD
    "" can be used to clear the buffer.

^UUsage^U

    KEYBOARD is used in combination with commands and functions that expect
    keyboard input as data and control information.  These can be wait
    states such as ACCEPT, INPUT, and READ. or interface functions such as
    ACHOICE() and DBEDIT().

    As a typical example, you can use KEYBOARD from within a SET KEY
    procedure to reassign keys in a wait state.  Another use is within the
    ACHOICE() user function.  here you KEYBOARD the keys you want ACHOICE()
    to execute before returning control to it.  The same concept applies to
    the DBEDIT() user function.

    Each execution of KEYBOARD clears the keyboard buffer.
