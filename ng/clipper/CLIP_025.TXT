    PROCEDURE identifies the beginning of each procedure.

^USyntax^U

    PROCEDURE <procedure name>

^UUsage^U

    Each separate procedure within a procedure file must begin with the
    PROCEDURE command followed by the procedure name.  The name can be up
    to 10 characters in length and must begin with an alpha character.

    Each procedure name must be unique from all other procedures,
    functions, programs, and formats within the same application, or else
    errors in compilation or linking will occur.

    A procedure is any executable block of code beginning with the
    statement PROCEDURE <proc name> and can occur anywhere in a program
    file, but cannot be nested within other procedures.

    To terminate execution and branch back to the calling procedure,
    execute a RETURN.  Unlike FUNCTIONs, a RETURN statement is not
    required.  When compiling, Clipper assigns all statements from the
    PROCEDURE statement to the procedure name until another PROCEDURE
    statement, FUNCTION statement, or end-of-file mark (1A hex) is
    encountered.
