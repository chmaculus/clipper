^BLABEL FORM^B

    To display labels from a definition held in a (.lbl) file.

^USyntax^U

    LABEL FORM <file1>/(<expC1>) [<scope>] [FOR <condition>]
    [WHILE <condition>] [SAMPLE] [TO PRINT] [TO FILE <file2>/(<expC2>)]

^UArgument^U

    <file1> is the name of the (.lbl) file that contains the FORM
    definition of the LABEL.  If the extension is not specified (.lbl) is
    assumed.

^UOptions^U

    ^BScope^B: The <scope> is the portion of the current database file to
    display labels.  The default is ALL.

    ^BCondition^B: The FOR clause specifies the conditional set of records
    to LABEL FORM within the given scope.  The WHILE clause specifies the
    set of records meeting the condition from the current record until the
    condition fails.

    ^BPrint^B: The TO PRINT clause echoes output to the printer.

    ^BFile^B: The TO FILE clause echoes output to the specified filename,
    <file2>.  If an extension is not specified, (.txt) is added.

    ^BSample^B: The SAMPLE clause displays test labels as rows of
    asterisks.  Each test label has the same number of columns and rows as
    the label definition.  Then following each test label display is the
    query, "Do you want more samples?"  Answering "Y" repeats the display
    of the test label.  Answering "N" causes LABEL FORM to display the
    actual labels for the specified scope and condition.

^UUsage^U

    LABEL FORM displays labels using a definition stored in a (.lbl) file.
    The .lbl file can be created using RL.EXE, which is provided with the
    Clipper distribution diskettes.

    The contents of a LABEL field must be a valid expression.  Note that
    Clipper does not support an expression list in the LABEL FORM contents.
    Anything following a comma in a LABEL FORM is ignored.
