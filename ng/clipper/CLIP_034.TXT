^BREPORT FORM^B

    To display a tabular and optionally grouped report with page and column
    headings from a definition held in a .frm file.

^USyntax^U

    REPORT FORM <file1>/(<expC1>) [<scope>] [FOR <condition>]
    [WHILE <condition>] [TO PRINT] [TO FILE <file2>/(<expC2>)]
    [SUMMARY] [PLAIN] [HEADING <expC3>] [NOEJECT]

^UArgument^U

    <file1> is the name of the (.fmt) file that contains the FORM
    definition of the REPORT.  If the extension is not specified (.frm) is
    assumed.

^UOptions^U

    ^BScope^B: The <scope> is the portion of the current database file to
    report.  The default is ALL.

    ^BCondition^B: The FOR clause specifies the conditional set of records
    to report within the given scope.  The WHILE clause specifies the set
    of records meeting the condition from the current record until the
    condition fails.

    ^BPrint^B: The TO PRINT clause echoes output to the printer.

    ^BFile^B: The TO FILE clause echoes output to the specified filename,
    <file2>, without form feed characters (ASCII 12).  If an extension is
    not specified, (.txt) is added.

    ^BSummary^B: The SUMMARY clause causes the REPORT FORM to display only
    group, subgroup, and grand total lines.  Detail lines are suppressed.

    ^BPlain^B: The PLAIN clause suppresses the display of the date, page
    number, and pagination.  In addition, the report title and column
    headings display only at the top of the report.

    ^BHeading^B: The HEADING clause places the result of <expC3> on the
    first line of each page.  <expC3> is evaluated only once at the
    beginning of the report and before the record pointer is moved.

    ^BNoeject^B: The NOEJECT clause suppresses the initial page eject when
    the TO PRINT clause is used.

^UUsage^U

    The REPORT FORM executes a report using a definition stored in a (.frm)
    file. The .frm file can be created using RL.EXE, which is provided with
    the Clipper distribution diskettes.

    If you want to include form feed characters when sending the REPORT
    FORM TO FILE, add the lines of code shown below to your program:

    ^RSET PRINTER TO <file>      ^R
    ^RREPORT FORM <file> TO PRINT^R
    ^RRSET PRINTER TO            ^R
