^BRESTORE^B

    RESTORE retrieves and activates memory variables from a memory file.

^USyntax^U

    RESTORE FROM <filename> [ADDITIVE]

^UDefaults^U

    A .mem file extension is assumed unless otherwise specified.

^UUsage^U

    When you RESTORE memory variables in a program file, all of the
    currently active memory variables are deleted unless ADDITIVE is
    specified.  Unless you redeclare memory variables as PUBLIC in a
    program file, the variables are restored as PRIVATE.  Memory variables
    you restore from the dot prompt, however, always come back as PUBLIC.

    No more than 64,000 memory variables may be active at any time.

^UOptions^U

    To retain the current memory variables, include the ADDITIVE option,
    which causes the RESTOREd memory variables to be added to the current
    one.  Any current memory variables with the same name are overwritten.
    To restore variables in a memory file as PUBLIC, you must redeclare
    them as PUBLIC before you RESTORE the memory file and use the ADDITIVE
    option.
