^BSET COLOR^B

    SET COLOR allows the selection of colors for use on color monitors, or
    screen attributes for use on monochrome monitors.

^USyntax^U

    SET COLOR TO [<standard> [,<enhanced>] [,<border>] [,<background>]
    [<unselected>]}/(<expC>)

^UOptions^U

    ^BStandard/Enhanced^B: The "standard" and "enhanced" displays are color
    pairs with a foreground and an optional background color.  "Standard"
    is used by all output, such as @...SAY and ?.  "Enhanced" setting
    affects only the display of GETs.

    ^BBorder^B: Sets the border color.

    ^BBackground^B: The "background" is not currently supported by any
    machines for which Nantucket provides drivers.

    ^BAttributes^B: High intensity and blinking are the attributes of
    colors.  High intensity is denoted by "+" and blinking with "*".  Each
    attribute specified is applied to the foreground color no matter where
    it occurs in the setting definition.

    SET COLOR TO with no argument restores the default values which are:
    W/N,N/W,,,N/W

^UUsage^U

    There are number of colors supported for enhancing screen display.
    Each color is denoted by a letter or number.  When you specify a color
    setting, numbers and letters should not be mixed.  When numbers are
    used, the number to the left of the slash is written to the high order
    4 bits of the color attribute byte, and the number to the right is
    written to the low order 4 bits.

    The following table lists the colors available:

         ^UColor              Letter         Number^U
         BLACK              N              0
         BLUE               B              1
         GREEN              G              2
         CYAN               BG             3
         RED                R              4
         MAGENTA            RB             5
         BROWN              GR             6
         WHITE              W              7
         GREY               N+
         YELLOW             GR+
         BLANK              X
         Underline          U
         Inverse Video      I

    On monochrome monitors, color is not supported.  Clipper, however,
    supports the monochrome attributes reverse video (I) and underlining
    (U).


    ^BNote^B: SET COLOR TO using numbers is not supported if you link
    ANSI.OBJ.

    ^BColor variables^B: To make managing color easier, consider the
    assignment of colors to memory variables.  This will allow you to
    centralize the assignment of colors and implementation of runtime color
    configuration for users.

    To set each color configuration, assign the complete SET COLOR argument
    as a character string to a single memory variable.  Then use macro
    substitution or bound the color variable when you SET COLOR.

    Use the ISCOLOR() function to set up different color configurations for
    color and monochrome monitors.
