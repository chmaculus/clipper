^BFIND^B

    FIND searches an indexed database file for the first record with an
    index key that matches the specified character string or number.  FIND
    conducts a very rapid record search.

^USyntax^U

    FIND <character string>/(<expC>)

^UArgument^U

    <character string> is all or part of the index key of a record you are
    searching for.  if an expression (<expC>) is specified instead of a
    literal character string, FIND operates the same as SEEK.

^UUsage^U

    FIND searches the controlling index starting with the first key and
    proceeds until a match is found or there is a key value greater than
    the search argument.  If there is a match, the record pointer is
    positioned to the record number found in the index.  If SOFTSEEK is OFF
    (the default) and FIND does not find a record, the record pointer is
    positioned to LASTREC() + 1, EOF() returns true (.T.), and FOUND()
    returns false (.F.).  If SOFTSEEK is ON, the record pointer is
    positioned to the record with the first key value greater than the
    search argument and FOUND() returns false (.F.).  In this case, EOF()
    only returns true (.T.) if there are no keys in the index greater than
    the search argument.

    ^BLeading blanks^B: If a literal search argument has leading blanks, it
    must be delimited with quote marks and have the same number of leading
    blanks as the index key.

    ^BMacro substitution^B: The search argument can be a macro variable if
    not bounded by parentheses.  The syntax for this is &<memvar>.

    ^BNumeric keys^B: Clipper stores numeric index keys with leading zeros.
    This means that to FIND a numeric key with a literal search argument,
    you must pad it with leading zeros so there are as many digits in the
    search argument as there are whole number digits in the index key.  The
    number of decimal digits does not matter unless the number contains
    decimal values other than zero.
