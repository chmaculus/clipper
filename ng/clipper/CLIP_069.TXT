^BSET PATH^B

    SET PATH specifies the search path that Clipper follows when attempting
    to access files.

^USyntax^U

    SET PATH TO [<path list>]

^UArgument^U

    <path list> identifies the paths where Clipper searches for a file if
    it is not found in the current directory.  A path is a pointer to a
    directory.  It includes a list of all the directories from the root to
    the specified directory separated by backslashes.  A path list then is
    the sequence of paths to search, each separated by a comma or semi-
    colon.

    Note: Because the semi-colon is a path list separator, continuation of
    a path command line with a semi-colon is not supported.

    SET PATH TO with no argument releases the path list and Clipper only
    searches the current directory.

^UUsage^U

    SET PATH allows Clipper to find and update existing files in another
    drive and/or directory.  When you attempt to access a file Clipper
    first looks for it in the current drive and directory.  The current
    disk drive and directory is established when your Clipper application
    is loaded, or by SET DEFAULT.  If the file is not found, Clipper then
    searches the path list you specified path by path until the first
    instance of the file is found.  Note that FILE() respects the PATH
    SETting when searching for the existence of a file.

    The path, however, is only for finding existing files.  If you wish to
    create new files in another drive or directory, use SET DEFAULT TO
    <directory> or explicitly declare the path when specifying the
    filename.

    To configure a compiled application to a site-specific path setting at
    runtime, pass a DOS environmental variable to your application program,
    retrieve its value with GETE(), and SET PATH with this value.  For
    example, in DOS

       ^RC> SET CLIP_PATH=C:\APPS\DATA, C:\APPS\PROGS^R

    Later in the configuration section of your application program:

    ^Rpath_set = GETE(:CLIP_PATH")^R
    ^RSET PATH TO &path_set       ^R
