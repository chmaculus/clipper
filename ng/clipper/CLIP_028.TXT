    READ enters full-screen editing mode using the current pending GETs.

^USyntax^U

    READ [SAVE]

^UUsage^U

    READ executes full-screen editing using all GETs pending since the most
    recent CLEAR, CLEAR GETS, CLEAR ALL or READ.  If there is a FORMAT SET,
    READ passes control to it before entering full-screen edit.

    Within a READ, you can edit the contents of and navigate between GETs.
    Whenever you press a key that terminates a GET, control passes to the
    VALID clause if it has been specified.  A return value of true (.T.)
    terminates the GET and processes the navigation key.  A false (.F.)
    value does not process the navigation key.  The following keys are
    available during READ:
