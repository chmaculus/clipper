!Short: System Error      Usually caused by lack of available memory
                                 ^BSYSTEM ERROR^B

    This error indicates an internal problem with the Clipper system.  Most
    of the time these errors are caused by a lack of available memory.  For
    example, there may be enough memory available for the load module
    (.EXE) file, but not quite enough to actually execute the statements in
    the program.  The problem may also be caused by an index file that has
    become corrupted.

    If you experience one of these errors, halt the program by entering Q
    at the "Q/A/I" prompt.  CHeck the memory availability by the following:

    - Check the load module size provided by Plink86 when you linked the
      program.

    - Add 64K bytes to the load module size.

    - Execute the DOS "CHKDSK" command to ascertain the amount of memory
      available.

    - Compare the amount of memory available with the memory required for
      your program.

    In addition to the above, check your index files for possible problems.
