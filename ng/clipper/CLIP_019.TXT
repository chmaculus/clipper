^BLOCATE^B

    LOCATE searches the active database file for a record that satisfies
    specified criteria.

^USyntax^U

    LOCATE [<scope>] [FOR <condition>] [WHILE <condition>]

^UDefaults^U

    Unless otherwise restricted by the scope or a WHILE clause, LOCATE
    searches the entire database beginning with the first record.

^UUsage^U

    The NEXT <n> option for the scope limits the search to the specified
    number of records and begins the search at the current record.

    To find the next occurrences of the specified condition, use the
    CONTINUE command.

 ^URecord Pointer^U

    If a match is found, the record pointer moves to that record and
    displays the record number.  FOUND() returns .T.

    If no match is found, the record pointer moves to the end of the file
    (EOF() is .T.) or the end of the scope if one was specified.  The
    message ^BEnd of locate scope^B will be displayed.  FOUND() returns .F.

^USpecial Cases^U

    Unless the scope is NEXT <n>, REST, or WHILE, LOCATE starts searching
    at the beginning of the file.  If there are multiple LOCATEs, the most
    recent overrides any other.

    LOCATE and CONTINUE are specific to the work area in which they are
    issued.  You can have a different LOCATE/CONTINUE for each work area.
    If you leave the work area, they will still be in effect when you
    return.
