^BRETURN^B

    RETURN is used to restore control to either the calling procedure or
    the operating system.

^USyntax^U

    RETURN [<exp>]

^UArgument^U

    <exp> evaluates to the return value if the current program structure is
    a user-defined function.

^UUsage^U

    When RETURN is used in the highest level program, control passes to the
    operating system.  In a procedure, Clipper returns to the calling
    procedure and releases all PRIVATE memory variables.

    There can be more than one RETURN in a procedure or user-defined
    function.  A procedure or user-defined function need not, however, end
    with a RETURN.  Since user-defined functions must return values, each
    must contain at least one RETURN with an argument.

    Note that Clipper does not support RETURN TO MASTER or any other form
    of RETURN specifying the level of the call to return to, although
    RETURN TO MASTER can be simulating via BEGIN SEQUENCE...BREAK.
