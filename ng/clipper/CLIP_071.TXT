^BSET PRINTER^B

    Selects a DOS device for printer output.

^USyntax^U

    SET PRINTER TO [<device>/<file>/(<expC>)]

^UArgument^U

    <device> sends the printed output to the network or the local device.
    For some networks, the work station's printer should first be
    redirected to the file server (usually by running the network spooler
    program).

    <file> sends all printer output including @...SAYs to the specified
    filename.  If you do not specify a file extension, Clipper appends a
    .prn extension to the filename.

    SET PRINTER TO with no arguments closes the print spool file and
    resets the default destination.

    SETting the PRINTER TO a non-existent device creates a file with the
    name of the device.

^UUsage^U

    The default device is PRN.

    SET PRINTER directs printed output from any print-related command to
    the specified device.  Device names include LPT1, LPT2, LPT3 (all
    parallel ports), COM1, and COM2 (serial ports).

    ^BNote:^B When specifying device names, be sure not to specify a
    trailing colon.

    This capability has several uses:

    o  You can swap ports for managing multiple printers.

    o  You can direct output to a file for printing later or transfer to a
       remote computer via telecommunications.

    o  You can empty the printer spooler and reset the default device.
