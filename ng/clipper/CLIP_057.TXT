^BSET EXACT^B

    SET EXACT determines whether a comparison between two character strings
    requires the strings to be the same length.

^USyntax^U

    SET EXACT on/OFF/(<expL>)

^UDefaults^U

    When EXACT is OFF two characters are compared according to the
    following rules:

    1.  The strings are first considered equivalent (.T.).

    2.  Strings are then compared by character position for each character
        in both strings until the length of the string on the right side of
        the operator is exhausted or the comparison returns false (.F.).

    This has two implications:

    1.  Two strings may equate even though they vary in length.

    2.  A string of length greater than zero can equate to a null string.
        This happens because a null string on the right side of the
        operator has a length of zero and so no comparisons are made.  The
        result returns is then the initial value, true (.T.).

    With SET EXACT ON, two strings must match exactly, except for trailing
    blanks.  The same characters (upper and lower case) must be in the same
    order, and be of the same length to return true (.T.).
