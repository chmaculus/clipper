^BSET ALTERNATE^B

    SET ALTERNATE directs output from commands other than @...SAY...GET to
    a text file.

^USyntax^U

    SET ALTERNATE TO [<file>/(<expC>)]

    SET ALTERNATE ON/OFF

^UOption^U

    ^BTo^B: Specifying a <file> as the argument of the TO clause opens a
    standard ASCII text file with a default extension of .txt.  The
    filename can optionally include an extension, drive letter, and/or
    path.  If a file with the same name exists, subsequent ouput will
    overwrite the current contents of that file.

    ^BToggle^B: SET ALTERNATE on/OFF toggles the echo of output to the
    current alternate file.  Note that when you SET ALTERNATE OFF, the
    alternate file is not closed.

^UUsage^U

    Alternate files are not related to work areas and only one may be open
    at a time.  To close an alternate file, use CLOSE ALTERNATE, CLOSE ALL,
    or SET ALTERNATE TO with no argument.  Note that @...SAYs cannot be
    echoed to a disk file using SET ALTERNATE, but SET PRINTER TO
    <filename> does support this feature.
