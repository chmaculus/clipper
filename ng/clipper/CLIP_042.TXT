^BSELECT^B

    SELECT changes the current work area.

^USyntax^U

    SELECT <work area>/<alias>/(<expN>)

^UArgument^U

    <work area> is a number between zero and 254 inclusive.  Zero
    designates the first available work area beginning with work area one.

    <alias> is the name of an existing work area if there is a database
    file open in that area.  The first 10 work areas can be referred to
    with the letters A through J.  Specifying a non-existent alias produces
    a run-time error.

    (<expN>) is a numeric expression that evaluates to a number between
    zero and 254.  The expression must be bounded by opposing parentheses
    to be evaluated.

^UUsage^U

    Clipper supports 254 work areas.  SELECTing 0 selects the first unused
    area.  Within each work area, you can open a database file and up to 15
    index files.  Each work area has a number of attributes which include:

    ^BAttribute^B                  ^BFunction^B
    Alias name                 ALIAS()
    Work area number           SELECT()
    Database file              ALIAS()
    Index file(s)              INDEXORD()/INDEXKEY()
    Exclusivity                FLOCK()/NETERR()

    Filter condition
    Deleted filter
    Locate condition
    Relation(s)

    Number of records          LASTREC()/RECCOUNT()
    Number of fields           FCOUNT()
    Record number              RECNO()
    Beginning-of-file flag     BOF()
    End-of-file flag           EOF()
