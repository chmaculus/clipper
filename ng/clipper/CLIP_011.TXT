    active database file.

    GO/GOTO <expN>/BOTTOM/TOP

^UArgument^U

    <expN> is the specific record to move the record pointer to.  GOTO
    moves the record pointer to this record even if DELETED is ON or it
    falls outside the scope of the current filter.

^UOptions^U

    ^BBottom^B: GO/GOTO BOTTOM moves to the last logical record in the
    current work area if there is an active index or LASTREC() if there
    isn't one.  If DELETED is ON or there is an active FILTER, this is the
    last record in the filter scope.

    ^BTop^B: GO/GOTO TOP moves to the first logical record in the
    current work area if there is an active index or record 1 if there
    is no index in USE.  If DELETED is ON or there is an active FILTER,
    this is the first record in the filter scope.
