^BFUNCTION^B

    FUNCTION declares user-defined functions in Clipper.

^USyntax^U

    FUNCTION <procedure>...RETURN <exp>

^UArguments^U

    <procedure> is the declared name of the user-defined function.
    Procedure and user-defined function names can be up to 10 characters in
    length.

    <exp> is the function return value.  All user-defined functions must
    return a value.

^UUsage^U

    User-defined functions are the same as procedures with two exceptions.
    They must begin with the FUNCTION declaration and contain a RETURN
    statement with an argument (in order to return a value).

    To call a user -defined function, use the same notation as you would
    when calling Clipper functions:

    ^Bfunction(<parameter list>)^B

    If you are not concerned with the return value, you can use the same
    notation to place a user-defined function on a line by itself.  In this
    case the return value is ignored.

    ^BPassing parameters^B: Parameters passed to user-defined functions are
    passed by value with two exceptions.  First, if the actual parameter is
    an array reference, the entire array is passed by reference.  Second,
    if the actual parameter is preceded by the "at" sign (@), it is passed
    by reference.

    For a more detailed discussion on passing parameters, refer to the
    entry for PARAMETERS in this chapter.
