    RELEASE deletes memory variables.

^USyntax^U

    RELEASE <memvar list> / [ALL[LIKE/EXCEPT <skeleton>]]

^UArguments^U

    <memvar list> is a list of memory variables to delete.

    <skeleton> is a wildcard mask specifying a group of memory variables to
    delete or exclude from deletion.

^UUsage^U

    RELEASE deletes memory variables in two basic ways.  If the scope of
    the deletion is a list, then the specified memory variables are deleted
    regardless of the memory variable scope unless they are hidden.  This
    means that PUBLIC and private memory variables declared in higher level
    procedures are RELEASEd.  If, however, the ALL clause is specified,
    then only memory variables defined in the current procedures are
    RELEASEd.

    Note that a hidden memory variable does not become accessible when the
    local copy is RELEASEd but only when the procedure in which it was
    declared PRIVATE terminates.
