^UOptions^U

    ^BScope^B: The <scope> is the portion of the current database file to
    RECALL.  The default scope is the current record.  If a condition is
    specified the scope becomes ALL.

    ^BCondition^B: The FOR clause specifies the conditional set of records
    to RECALL within the given scope.  The WHILE clause specifies the set
    of records meeting the condition from the current record until the
    condition fails.

^UUsage^U

    If DELETED is ON, RECALL only reinstates the current record or a
    specific record if you specify the RECORD scope.

^UNetwork^U

    In a network environment, RECALL requires the current record be locked
    with RLOCK() if you are RECALLing a single record; the current database
    file be locked with FLOCK() or USEd EXCLUSIVEly, if you are RECALLing
    several records.
