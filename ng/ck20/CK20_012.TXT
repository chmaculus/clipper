                              ^UAuto Security

    ^BAfter including header file <Security.ch>, all program can get
    ^BDatabase Security Function automatically.

    This function is called ^BAUTO-SECURITY^B in Casual-Kit.

    ^BAUTO-SECURITY is better than manual-security usually.

    AUTO-SECURITY will encrypt the header of database with a password to
    prevent other program to use it.  AUTO-SECURITY will decrypt database
    before using it and encrypt database while closing.

    AUTO-SECURITY can ^Bwork with CK-MU^B to make multi-user program work
    in security mode.

    AUTO-SECURITY will call the following functions automatically :

        Sec_Use()         use database
        Sec_Close()       close database
        Sec_Closeall()    close all database
        dbSecure()        secure database

    There are two public variables used by AUTO-SECURITY :

        _ckSecKey     =>  password of database, default is NIL
        _ckSecByte    =>  the length of header to secure, default is 4

       If you want to use special password or length to secure database,
       you must initialize variables before using/close any database.

    ^Bþ SEC.EXE is a utility program to lock/unlock database in DOS.
