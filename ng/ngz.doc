Purpose             To disassemble or report on NG v1.0 database files.


Format              NGZ ngfile.ng [/?][/R | /Poffset[/Q]]
                    /?  Brief help text
                    /R  Report only (.RPT)
                    /Poffset  Partial disassembly at _hex_ file offset.
                        E.g. /P1A44B
                        Run a report first to get the offset.
                        Don't use this on menu or short-to-short strucs.
                    /Q  Suppress screen output (Note: disables Ctrl-C)


Description         NGZ does what other NG disassemblers do, but it uses
                    a different, and somewhat faster, algorithm.
                    It can resolve all !Seealso references to other files
                    without aborting with an 'out of memory' error, and
                    resolve all !File references. Not by recursively read-
                    ing (and decrypting) the .NG byte by byte, but by in-
                    dexing and processing the file sequentially.

                    The NGZ source includes a near-complete description of
                    the NG file format. More details on the format and on
                    the disassembly algorithm in a note in NGZ.GLO.


Using NGZ           Type NGZ filename.NG for a complete disassembly, i.e.
                    a number of FILEnnn.ASC, a FILE.LCF, a FILE.MAK, and
                    a FILE.RPT, = source, an NGML link control file, a
                    MAKE script file, and a report file with brief statis-
                    tics, a file index, and entries on any unresolved see-
                    alsos (these were ignored at compilation time and can-
                    not be resolved; they'll appear in the .ASC as a ref-
                    erence to FILE999.NGO).

                         +----------------------------------------+
                           NOTE: Existing .ASC .LCF .MAK and .RPT
                                   files will be overwritten
                         +----------------------------------------+

                    During disassembly, NGZ outputs a simple odometer:
                    file number, 's' for a short struc, 'l' for a long,
                    and 'f' for a !File entry.

                    You should note that the /R, /P, and /Q switches are
                    last minute additions. Despite what the brief help text
                    says, you _can_ use the /P switch on a short-to-short
                    structure, but it will result in some garbage at the
                    !File entries (in fact, it can be run on any offset
                    since it bypasses all indexing, but aborts if offset
                    doesn't point to a short or long structure).

                    If you want to dig deeper into the structure headers,
                    e.g. if attempting to restore a currupt file, NGZ.INC
                    has some procedures that may be useful. However, these
                    are not implemented in NGZ.EXE.


Files               NGZ.PAS  Pascal source.
                    NGZ.GLO  Global definitions.
                    NGZ.INC  Support routines.
                    NGZ.DOC  This file.
                    NGZ.EXE  The executable.

                    TP6 was used for compilation but TP4+ should work
                    as well.


Credits             NGZ is my own work but I doubt it would have reached
                    the .exe state without a glance or two in the follow-
                    ing 2 programs (though my knowledge of C is limited
                    to a very few WORDs):

                    and distribute the five NGZ files on condition that the

                    exceeding distribution costs is charged.

                    To my knowledge, the NG file format was never placed in
                    the public domain; an American company is currently mar-
                    keting an NG update.

                    And you should, of course, take into consideration any
                    applicable copyright laws before using NGZ.
