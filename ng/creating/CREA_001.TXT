!short: Creating Source Files           An Overview
'------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 ^bCreating Norton Guides Source Files^b

     A Norton Guides database is created from two different kinds
     of source files:

          ^bData Source Files^b
                   contain the text that appears in the
                   Guides Window; and the

          ^bMenu Link Control File^b
                   defines the menu structure

     You write the text that will appear in your database into data
     source files. Each data file is then compiled, to produce a
     corresponding Norton Guides Object File.

     In addition to the data source files that contain the text of
     the database, you need to write a single ^bmenu link control^b
     ^bfile^b that defines the menu structure of the database, and
     names the menus and menu items. The linker then uses this
     control file to stitch all the compiled NG object files into a
     single Norton Guides Database file.

     All source files are standard ASCII. You can name source files
     with any extension you wish (or none at all), ^uexcept^u `.ng',
     which is reserved for the compiled and linked database, and
     `.ngo', which is reserved for compiled object files.

     To continue this tutorial, use the "seealso" window at the top
     of the screen to learn more about data source files: just
     press the Enter key display the entry on Data Source Files.

'------------------------------------------------------------------------------
^b Data Source Files^b

     To create a Norton Guides database, the text that is to appear
     in the database is written into one or more data source files.

     A single data source file is created for each menu item. If,
     for example, you had a database with three menus, and each
     menu contained three items, you would have nine separate data
     source files. (Actually, you might have more, since you can
     break up the data for a single menu item across several data
     source files.)

     All the data that appears in a Norton Guides database, and
     hence the data you type into a source file, is structured into
     one of two types:

                ^bShort Entries^b, and

                ^bLong Entries^b

     Use the "seealso" window at the top of the screen to learn
     more about short and long entrys.

!short: Short and Long Entries          The Basic Building Blocks of NG Databases
'------------------------------------------------------------------------------
^b Short and Long Entries - Building Blocks of a Database^b

     Short and long entries are the basic "building blocks" of a
     Norton Guides database: Text appears in a Norton Guides
     Database either as a list of short entries, or as a single
     long entry.

     A short entry is a single line of text. Short entries almost
     never appear alone; they are found as elements in a ^blist^b of
     short entries. Each short entry can be thought of as an ^bindex^b
     pointing to a longer, more complete description, called a long
     entry.

     The long entry is displayed by ^bexpanding^b the short entry; you
     can think of the long entry as "lying under" the short. What
     you are reading right now is a long entry; if you press the
     Escape key, you will move up to the short entry above it.
     (From the short entry above this, press Enter to return here.)

     A long entry such as this one can be anywhere from one line,
     up to hundreds of lines long. A long entry is something like a
     chapter in a book, and the list of short entries like the
     table of contents.

         ^bAt any one time^b, the Norton Guides can display either a
         ^blist^b of short entries, or a ^bsingle^b long entry.

     Long entries cannot be expanded. You can, however, include in
     a long entry references to other long entries, using the
     "!seealso" command. A "seealso" can refer either to a long
     entry in the same file (which means it's also part of the same
     menu item) or in another file.

     A short entry does not have to have a long entry under it
     (that is, a short entry does not have to be expandable). You
     can design a list of short entries so that some, none, or all
     are expandable.

     Instead of having a long entry under it, you can also design
     short entries that expand to ^banother^b ^blist^b of short entries.
     There is virtually no limit to the length of a chain of "short
     entry points to list of short entries." (A long entry,
     however, can only appear at the endpoint of a chain.)

!short: Creating Entries                Writing the Database
'------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 ^bWriting the Database: Creating Entries^b

     Short entries are created by typing the command `!short:',
     ^bstarting in column one^b, immediately followed by the text of
     the short entry on the same line.

     A long entry is created by typing text immediately under the
     short entry; this is the text that the short entry will expand
     to when the user selects the "Expand" menu. Long entries can
     be 78 characters wide, and up to 17k in length.

     Instead of including the text of a long entry immediately
     under the short entry that points to it, you can substitute
     the `!file' command, followed by a filename. You then type the
     text of the long entry into the file specified in the !file
     command. (You also use the !file command when you are
     designing a short entry that points to another ^blist^b of short
     entries; see also the !file command.)

     Long entries can refer the reader to other long entries using
     the `!seealso' command. See !seealso for information on how to
     write such references.

     You can include ^uunderline^u, ^Bbold^B, and ^Rreverse^R video
     attributes in the text of your source files; read the
     reference on character attributes for more information.

!short: Character Attributes            Reverse, Underline, and Bold
'------------------------------------------------------------------------------
^BAdding Character Attributes^B

     You can include underline, bold, and reverse video attributes
     in the text of both long and short entries by surrounding the
     text with the two characters:

           ^^U      for ^Uunderline^U
           ^^B      for ^Bbold^b
           ^^R      for ^Rreverse^r

     Note:  Type the caret character (the shifted 6 key), followed
            by the letter U, B, or R, rather than holding down the
            Control key and typing the letter. (If you actually
            want the characters ^^B to appear in the text, rather
            than turning on Bold, type two carets.) If not
            terminated by a matching pair later on in the same
            line, an attribute is automatically terminated by the
            end of the line.
