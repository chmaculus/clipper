 Runtime configuration of CA-Clipper-compiled programs
컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

     Environment Variable:

     ^bSET CLIPPER=
        ^b[//BADCACHE]
        ^b[//CGACURS]
        ^b[//DYNF:<nHandles>]
        ^b[//E:<nExpandedKBytes>]
        ^b[//F:<nHandles>]
        ^b[//INFO]
        ^b[//NOIDLE]
        ^b[//SWAPK:<nBytes>]
        ^b[//SWAPPATH:'<path>']
        ^b[//TEMPPATH:'<path>']
        ^b[//X:<nKBytes>]

     ^bNote:^b  If you link your application with CA-Clipper/Exospace, you
     can specify application environment settings using an environment
     variable name other than CLIPPER.  See the EXOSPACE EXECUTABLE CLIPPER
     command in the "Protected Mode Linker" entry in this database for a
     list of these settings.

     Application Command Line:

     ^bC><app> [//<setting> ... ] [<app arguments>]

     The following rules apply when specifying environment settings,
     regardless of whether they are specified on the application command
     line or in the CLIPPER environment variable.

     ^b^CFE^b  Preface each setting with a double-slash

     ^b^CFE^b  Place a single blank space between settings

     ^b^CFE^b  Place a colon between setting and argument, with no intervening space

     It is possible to specify a setting twice, once in the CLIPPER
     environment variable and then again on the application command line.  If
     you do this, settings on the command line override like settings in the
     environment variable.  This feature provides an easy way to define those
     settings that are more or less permanent using the CLIPPER environment
     variable and to override those settings on an application-by-application
     basis.

 ^bDescription^b

     CA-Clipper provides runtime configuration control of CA-Clipper-
     compiled programs with a number of settings.  You can specify settings
     in the DOS environment variable CLIPPER or on the command line used to
     invoke an application.  You can enter the CLIPPER variable at the DOS
     prompt or include it in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file.  If the user will be
     accessing the application from a network, you can also add the SET
     CLIPPER command to the user's login script.

     Settings that you specify on the application program command line must
     precede application arguments.  If you wish to use the command line
     method instead of the CLIPPER environment variable but want to hide the
     complexity from your end user, use an application batch file to invoke
     the application with the configuration settings.

 ^bSettings^b

     ^bBADCACHE^b causes the Virtual Memory Manager (VMM) to preserve and
     restore the state of the EMM page frame before and after every EMM
     access (the EMM page frame is an area in real address space through
     which EMM data is accessed).  This setting can be used to correct
     problems when there are conflicts with other programs that use EMM.

     Note that on some EMM systems, the BADCACHE setting may adversely
     affect VMM performance.  It should be used only if you experience disk
     or file corruption because of a conflict with a disk cache or other
     resident software.

     ^bCGACURS^b prevents the use of the extended cursor capability of the
     EGA/VGA.  Specifying this setting may preclude some cursor modes by
     some display adaptors.  CGACURS prevents the cursor weirdness when a
     CA-Clipper program is executed in some multitasking and TSR
     environments.

     ^bDYNF:<nHandles>^b specifies the number of file handles the dynamic
     overlay system is allowed to use.  Valid settings range from 1 to 8,
     inclusive.  If not specified, the default is 2.

     ^bE:<nExpandedKBytes>^b restricts the amount of expanded memory
     automatically allocated to <nExpandedKBytes>.  CA-Clipper-compiled
     programs can use expanded memory to speed up processing, as well as
     some disk-based operations.  CA-Clipper can use memory configured as
     expanded memory according to the Lotus-Intel-Microsoft (LIM) Expanded
     Memory Specification (EMS) version 4.0 or higher.

     Expanded memory is automatically allocated in its entirety at startup;
     there is no dynamic allocation as execution proceeds.  The maximum
     amount allocated is limited by four factors:

     ^B^CFE^B  The amount of expanded memory available
     ^B^CFE^B  The //E:<nExpandedKBytes> environment setting
     ^B^CFE^B  A theoretical maximum of 32 MB
     ^B^CFE^B  The amount of conventional memory available

     The E parameter can be used to restrict the amount of expanded memory
     automatically allocated to <nExpandedKBytes>.  For example, specifying
     the following E parameter restricts the expanded memory CA Clipper will
     allocate to 2 MB:

     SET CLIPPER=//E:2000

     Note that a certain amount of conventional memory must be used to
     contain management tables for the virtual memory system--the more total
     memory (both conventional and expanded), the more space taken up by
     this control information.  The amount of expanded memory used may be
     less than the amount available if there is insufficient conventional
     memory to hold the tables.

     ^bF:<nHandles>^b is used in combination with the value specified with
     the FILES setting in CONFIG.SYS to inform CA-Clipper of the maximum
     number of file handles to use.  This setting is only valid for
     application programs using more than 20 files and running under DOS
     3.3 or greater.  When specified, CA-Clipper determines the number of
     files that can be opened using the smaller of the F setting and the
     CONFIG.SYS FILES setting.  For example, if the FILES command is set to
     120 and the F parameter is set to 50, the maximum number of files that
     can be opened is 50.  The ideal <nHandles> is an odd number that is 5
     less than specified with the FILES settings.

     ^bINFO^b Provides the following information about CA-Clipper's memory
     usage at application startup.

     ^B^CFE^B  The first line describes the general product version, revision,
        and international version.

     ^B^CFE^B  DS=<offset>:0000 is the address for the data segment or DGROUP.

     ^B^CFE^B  DS avail=<memory>KB reflects the amount of DGROUP available.

     ^B^CFE^B  OS avail=<memory>KB represents the amount of conventional
        memory available for VMM swap space.

     ^B^CFE^B  EMM avail=<EMM memory>KB shows the amount of EMM (expanded
        memory) allocated to the current application.

     ^B^CFE^B  Fixed Heap=<fixed heap>KB/<number of fixed segments> shows the
        size of the fixed heap in kilobyte increments in addition to the
        number of fixed segments.

     ^bNOIDLE^b prevents CA-Clipper from detecting and taking advantage of idle
     time during execution of compiled applications.

     If NOIDLE is not specified, CA-Clipper detects idle states (for example,
     keyboard wait states) during execution of compiled applications.  When
     an idle condition is detected, the system uses the slack time to perform
     garbage collection, file updates, and other routine housekeeping duties.
     This increases system performance by performing this work while the
     application is waiting for user input.

     ^bNote: ^bNOIDLE is provided for applications in which idle time processing
     is unacceptable.  Since it reduces overall system performance, its use
     is generally not recommended.

     ^bSWAPK:<nBytes>^b specifies the maximum allowable size of the disk
     swap file used for the virtual memory (VM) system.  Settings are
     specified in KB increments.  Valid settings range from 256 to 65,535,
     inclusive.  If this setting is not specified, the default is 16,384
     (16 MB).

     ^bNote: ^bSwap space is only allocated as needed--a particular setting
     does not guarantee that the swap file will get that big.  Suppressing or
     restricting disk swapping may cause an application to fail.

     ^bSWAPPATH:'<path>'^b specifies the location of the virtual memory swap
     file.  If not specified, the swap file is created in the current DOS
     drive and directory.

     ^bTEMPPATH:'<path>'^b controls the placement of temporary files created
     during sorting and indexing.  By default these files are placed in
     the current DOS directory or in the directory specified by the SET TMP
     environment variable, if it is defined.

     ^bNote: ^bTemporary files created during sorting and indexing can be quite
     large.  Setting TEMPPATH to a small volume (for example, a ram disk) may
     cause these operations to fail.  In general, the volume where these
     temporary files will be written should have an available capacity at
     least twice the size of the largest index to be created or database file
     to be sorted.

     ^bX:<nKBytes>^b specifies the amount of memory to exclude from being
     allocated, except for the RUN command.  Specified in kilobytes, valid
     values range from zero to 64, inclusive.  If not specified, the default
     value is zero.

     ^bNote:^b  If you link your application with CA-Clipper/Exospace, there
     are several additional runtime environment settings that you can use to
     control the VM system.  See the EXOSPACE EXECUTABLE CLIPPER command in
     the "Protected Mode Linker" entry in this database for a list of these
     settings.

 ^bExamples^b

     This example shows a series of settings using the CA-Clipper
     environment variable:

     SET CLIPPER=//F:50 //DYNF:4 //SWAPK:4096 //NOIDLE

     This example shows how the same settings can be used on the
     application's command line:

     ACCOUNTS //F:50 //DYNF:4 //SWAPK:4096 //NOIDLE

    ^bSET TMP=<pathName>^b

 ^bArguments^b

    ^b<pathName>^b is the name of the directory where temporary files are
    created.

 ^bDescription^b

    The TMP environment variable specifies a single directory where both
    CLIPPER.EXE and BLINKER.EXE write temporary work files.  If this variable
    is not specified, temporary files are created in the current directory.
    The /T compiler option can be used to override the TMP setting for the
    current compiler session.

    In the process of some operations, such as sorting and indexing,
    CA-Clipper creates temporary files.  These files are created either in
    the current directory or in the directory specified by the environment
    variable TMP.

 ^bExamples^b

    To assign a TMP variable, place a command line like the following in
    the user's AUTOEXEC.BAT file:
