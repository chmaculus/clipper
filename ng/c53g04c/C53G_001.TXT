 ^bCA-Clipper Compiler--CLIPPER.EXE^b
 Compiles one or more program files (.prg) containing procedures and user-
 defined functions to form an object file (.OBJ).
컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

     ^bCLIPPER [<sourceFile> | @<scriptFile> [<option list>]]

 ^bArguments^b

     ^b<sourceFile>^b is the name of the program file to compile to an object
     file.  If no extension is specified, (.prg) is assumed.  The filename
     can optionally include a drive designator and a path reference.

     ^b<scriptFile>^b is the name of an ASCII text file containing a list of
     source files to compile into a single object file.  The default
     extension for this file is (.clp).

     ^b<option list>^b is a list of one or more options to control the course
     of the compilation, all of which are described below.  To get a list of
     options, specify the compiler command line with no arguments.

 ^bCompiler Options^b

     All options are shown in uppercase preceded by a slash (/).  Note,
     however, that options are not case-sensitive and that you can replace
     the slash with a dash (-) if you prefer.

     Some compiler options have arguments.  If an option has arguments,
     specify them after the option, with no space between the option and
     its first argument.

     ^b/A

     Declares any variable included in a PRIVATE, PUBLIC, or PARAMETERS
     statement as MEMVAR.

     ^b/B

     Includes debugging information in the object file.

     ^b/D<identifier>[=<text>]

     Defines an identifier to the preprocessor with <text> assigned to the
     <identifier> if specified.

     ^b/ES[<severityLevel>]

     Specifies the severity level of warnings.

     If <severityLevel> is 0 or omitted, the compiler does not set the DOS
     ERRORLEVEL upon exit if warnings are encountered.  This is the default
     behavior of the compiler.

     If <severityLevel> is 1, the compiler sets the DOS ERRORLEVEL upon exit
     if warnings are encountered but still generates an .OBJ file.

     If <severityLevel> is 2, the compiler sets the DOS ERRORLEVEL upon exit
     if warnings are encountered and does not generate an .OBJ file.  This
     effectively promotes warnings to error status.

     ^b/I<pathName>

     Adds the specified directory to the front of the INCLUDE path list.
     Multiple /I options can be specified in the same compiler session to
     specify several header file search directories.

     ^b/L

     Excludes the program source code line numbers from the object file.

     ^b/M

     Compiles only the current program file (.prg) suppressing automatic
     search for program files (.prg) referenced in a program file with the
     DO, SET FORMAT, and SET PROCEDURE commands.

     ^b/N

     Suppresses the automatic definition of a procedure with the same name as
     the program file (.prg).

     ^b/O<objFile>

     Defines the name and/or location of the output object file.

     ^b/P

     Preprocesses the program file (.prg) and copying the result to an output
     file with a (.ppo) extension.

     ^b/Q

     Prevents line numbers from displaying while compiling.

     ^b/R[<libFile>]

     Embeds a library search request in the object file.  If /R is specified
     without <libFile> name, the default requests for CLIPPER.LIB,
     EXTEND.LIB, DBFNTX.LIB, and TERMINAL.LIB are suppressed.  Multiple /R
     options can be specified in the same compiler session to embed more
     than one library request.

     ^b/S

     Checks the syntax of the current (.prg) file and no object file is
     generated.

     ^b/T<pathName>

     Specifies a different directory for temporary files generated during
     compilation.

     ^b/U[<userStandardHeaderFile>]

     Identifies an alternate standard header file to preprocess in place of
     the supplied STD.CH which is used automatically.

     ^b/V

     Forces the compiler to assume all references to undeclared or unaliased
     variable names are public or private variables.

     ^b/W

     Generates warning messages for undeclared or unaliased (ambiguous)
     variable references.

     ^b/Z

     Suppresses shortcutting optimizations on the logical operators .AND. and
     .OR.  This option is provided as an aid to isolating code that depends
     on the behavior of older versions of CA-Clipper.

!short: Protected Mode Linker              EXOSPACE.EXE   (command line)
'------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 ^bCA-Clipper Protected Mode Linker--EXOSPACE.EXE^b
 Combines objects files (.OBJ) with library files (.LIB) to form a protected-
 mode executable file (.EXE).
컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

     ^bEXOSPACE [@<lnkFile>] [<command list>]

 ^bArguments^b

     If you specify no arguments, CA-Clipper/Exospace displays a brief help
     screen.

     ^b<lnkFile>^b is the name of an ASCII text file called a script file
     from which the linker takes some or all of its input.  If you specify
     the file without an extension, .LNK is assumed.  You can optionally
     specify a drive designator and/or a path reference for the script file.

     You can use script files to automate linker sessions that you tend to
     repeat and sessions that are too long to enter from the command line--
     the DOS command line limit of 128 characters may be too restrictive for
     some linker sessions, necessitating the use of a script file.

     The only rule governing the format of a script file is that it contain
     valid linker commands.  You need not place the commands one to a line.
     The new line character, like a space or a Tab, is considered to be white
     space.  Therefore, if a command will not fit on one line, continue it on
     a new line by pressing Enter--no continuation character is necessary.

     The # character designates a comment.  When encountered, the rest of the
     line is ignored.

     You can nest script files using the @<lnkFile> syntax within a script
     file.  The named script file is read and executed by CA-Clipper/Exospace
     in its entirety.  When it terminates, control returns to the current
     script file.

     ^b<command list>^b is a list of linker commands separated by spaces.
     Linker commands on the command line either override or augment the same
     commands in a script file.  For example, a FILE command on the command
     line adds to any FILE commands in the script file, while an OUTPUT
     command overrides any OUTPUT commands in the script file.  See Linker
     Commands below for details on the syntax and behavior of specific
     commands.

     To invoke the linker, you must specify at least one FILE command to tell
     CA-Clipper/Exospace which object files you want to link.  You can
     specify this command either on the command line or in a script file.  If
     you attempt to invoke CA-Clipper/Exospace with command line arguments
     and do not specify a FILE command, the linker session will result in an
     error.

 ^bLinker Commands^b

     This section provides a brief description of all the CA-Clipper/Exospace
     commands.  You can specify commands on the CA-Clipper/Exospace command
     line or in a script file.  The commands are not case-sensitive, and you
     can specify them in whatever order you want.  The only command that is
     required to link is the FILE command--all others are optional.

     ^bEXOSPACE CLIPPER 501

     Specifies that you are linking a CA-Clipper 5.01 or 5.01a application.

     ^bEXOSPACE ENVIRONMENT CLIPPER <envName>

     Specifies the environment variable to use for application runtime
     configuration.

     ^bEXOSPACE ENVIRONMENT OVERRIDE

     Causes runtime configuration environment settings to override .EXE
     defaults.

     ^bEXOSPACE EXECUTABLE CLIPPER <settings>

     Hard-codes default runtime configuration settings in the .EXE.  See SET
     CLIPPER for details about available settings and syntax.  In addition to
     the settings listed there, the following additional settings are
     available for controlling the CA-Clipper/Exospace protected-mode VM
     system:

     LOWMEM:<nKBytes>--Sets the amount of low DOS memory to reserve for
     allocation by third-party libraries for interrupt routines.  The default
     is 0.  Ignore this unless your third-party library documentation
     specifically recommends that you set it.

     MAXMEM:<nKBytes>--Sets the maximum amount of physical memory to use
     before swapping to disk.  The default is 8096 KB, which is ample for
     most applications. In a task switching environment, you may want to
     lower this value.

     MINMEM:<nKBytes>--Sets the minimum amount of physical memory that must
     be available to run the program.  If there is not enough memory
     available, an error message is generated and the application returns to
     DOS.  The default is 1024 KB, which is the recommended minimum.

     VMSIZE:<nKBytes>--Sets the amount of virtual memory the VM system should
     provide.  The default is 8096 KB, which is ample for most applications.

     ^bEXOSPACE EXECUTABLE NODELETE

     Creates an .EXE even if errors occur during linking.

     ^bEXOSPACE PACKAGE <package list>

     Causes specified protected-mode support packages to be included in the
     .EXE.  The following packages are available--use one or more in a comma-
     separated list:

     8514--Specifies the IBM 8514 Display Adapter.  Allows direct calls from
     protected mode, with no mode switching.

     DOS25--Specifies the Absolute Disk Read/Write compatibility package.
     Services INT 25h and 26h.

     INT10--Specifies the Video BIOS compatibility package. Services INT 10h.

     IPX--Specifies the IPX/SPX compatibility package for Novell Networks.
     Services INT 7Ah.

     IPXCT--Specifies the compatibility package for CA-Clipper Tools.

     NET5C--Specifies the NETBIOS compatibility package.  Replaces
     NETBIOS?.OBJ.  Services INT 5Ch.

     NOVM--Disables the CA-Clipper/Exospace VM system.  The resulting
     application will run only on systems that have sufficient RAM to contain
     the application's entire .EXE and all its data.

     ^bEXOSPACE PROCEDURE DEPTH <maxDepth>

     Sets the stack size of an application in terms of maximum procedure call
     depth.

     ^bFILE <objFile list>

     Specifies one or more object files to be linked in a comma-separated
     list.

     ^bLIBRARY <libFile list>

     Specifies one or more library files to search during linking in a comma-
     separated list.

     ^bMAP [=<mapFile>] [<mapOption list>]

     Causes a map to be generated.  By default, the map file will have the
     same name as the resulting .EXE file.  The available map options are as
     follows--use one or more in a comma-separated list:

     A--Public symbols sorted by address

     N--Public symbols sorted by name

     S--Segments with assigned addresses

     ^bMODULE <moduleName> FROM <libName>

     Searches for named module in specified library only.

     ^bNODEFLIB | NODEFAULTLIBRARYSEARCH

     Does not search default libraries.

     ^bOUTPUT <exeFile>

     Specifies the name of the executable file to be generated.  If not
     specified, the first filename encountered on the CA-Clipper/Exospace
     command line (either object or script) is used, but with an .EXE
     extension.

     ^bSTACK <sizeBytes>

     Sets the stack size of an application in decimal bytes.  The value you
     specify can be any positive number up to 65,535.

컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

 ^bBlinker Commands

     Script file(s) are specified on the command line and default to an
     extension of .LNK.  They may be nested, and more than one may be used on
     the command line, for example:

     ^bBLINKER @Defaults @Other LIB Mylib VERBOSE

     This command line instructs Blinker to read the script file DEFAULTS.LNK
     followed by the script file OTHER.LNK.  It also instructs Blinker to use
     the library MYLIB.LIB and to display a VERBOSE listing of the .OBJ files
     being processed.  The full names of the commands, or any unique
     abbreviation of the words which comprise the commands, may be used
     although it is recommended that at least three letters be used for
     clarity.  For example, the command BLINKER OVERLAY OPSIZE 40 can be
     abbreviated to BLI OVE OPS 40.

     Most Blinker commands may be specified in any order, at any point in the
     link script file.  Typically the first FILE statement should specify the
     .OBJ containing the main program procedure.

     ^b# ...

     Indicates text as a script file comment.  Any line in the script file
     beginning with the character # is treated as a comment and is ignored by
     Blinker.  If the # ... character occurs within a line, the rest of the
     line is ignored.

     ^b// ...

     Indicates text as a script file comment.  Any line in the script file
     containing the characters // is treated as a comment and is ignored by
     Blinker.  If the // ... characters occur within a line, the rest of the
     line is ignored.

     ^b@<scriptname>

     Specify the name of a script file.  Blinker supports nested script files
     of any size to a depth of 5 levels.  The processing of nested script
     files is similar to a program function call.

     ^bBEGINAREA

     Specifies the start of a dynamic overlay area to the linker.  Each
     BEGINAREA should have a corresponding ENDAREA to indicate the end of the
     overlay area.

     ^bBLINKER CACHE EMS <nuMax[%]>
     ^b   [, <nuMinLeave[%]>]

     Specifies the amount of EMS (LIM version 4.0 and higher) memory to be
     used for the overlay cache.  Two numeric parameters are used to specify
     the amount of EMS memory to be allocated and the amount to be left for
     program use.  Both parameters may be specified as either a number of KB,
     or as a percentage of the total available EMS.

     ^bBLINKER CACHE XMS <nuMax[%]>
     ^b   [, <nuMinLeave[%]>]

     Specifies the amount of XMS (version 2.0 and higher) memory to be used
     for the overlay cache.  Two numeric parameters are used to specify the
     amount of XMS memory to be allocated and the amount to be left for
     program use.  Both parameters may be specified as either a number of KB,
     or as a percentage of the total available XMS.

     ^bBLINKER CLIPPER PAGE ON | OFF

     Enables/Disables automatic CA-Clipper 5.3 code paging.

     ^bBLINKER ENVIRONMENT CLIPPER <cName>

     Changes the name of the CA-Clipper environment variable from the default
     setting of "CLIPPER" to any string of up to 16 characters, and thus
     avoids the remote site settings for the CLIPPER environment variable.

     ^bBLINKER ENVIRONMENT NAME <cName>

     Specifies the name of the environment variable for Blinker runtime
     options.  By default, if the argument is not specified, the default
     setting is BLINKER.

     ^bBLINKER ENVIRONMENT OVERRIDE

     Commands Blinker to allow the CA-Clipper environment variables set using
     the BLINKER EXECUTABLE CLIPPER command to be overridden at application
     run time by the settings of the CLIPPER environment variable.  When
     doing this, you may want to consider renaming your CLIPPER environment
     variable with the command BLINKER ENVIRONMENT CLIPPER.

     ^bBLINKER EXECUTABLE CLIPPER <cEnvironmentstring>

     Burns default values for the CA-Clipper runtime environment variables
     into the executable file.  Those settings set using the BLINKER
     EXECUTABLE CLIPPER command take precedence over those set with the SET
     CLIPPER command.

     ^bBLINKER EXECUTABLE NODELETE

     Creates .EXE regardless of unresolved externals, although the resulting
     .EXE is not guaranteed to operate correctly.

     ^bBLINKER LINK EMS ON | OFF

     Controls whether or not EMS memory is used at link time by the virtual
     memory system within Blinker.

     ^bBLINKER LINK PAGEFRAME ON | OFF

     Controls the use of the EMS pageframe by Blinker at link time by the
     virtual memory system within Blinker.

     ^bBLINKER LINK XMS ON | OFF

     Controls whether or not XMS memory is used at link time by the virtual
     memory system within Blinker.

     ^bBLINKER MESSAGE DUPLICATES

     Causes Blinker to generate the 1004 link-time warning message for all
     duplicate symbols within libraries encountered at link time.

     ^bBLINKER MESSAGE NOBLINK

     ^bBLINKER MESSAGE NOWARNING

     Suppresses the display of Blinker link-time warning messages 1001 to
     1100.

     ^bBLINKER MESSAGE WINK [LEFT]

     Enables single eye winking during linking.  If no parameter is entered,
     the right eye will wink (from Blinker뭩 point of view, i.e., from inside
     the screen looking out).  The parameter LEFT causes the left eye to
     wink.

     ^bBLINKER OVERLAY OPSIZE <nuSize>

     Requests a size for the overlay pool at run time in KB.  It can be set
     to any value between 12KB and 128KB.  The default operating size is
     40KB.

     ^bBLINKER OVERLAY PAGEFRAME ON | OFF

     Allows the overlay manager to utilize the expanded memory pageframe for
     the overlay pool (maximum size 64Kb), on machines equipped with LIM EMS
     (3.2 or higher) expanded memory boards or emulators.

     ^bBLINKER OVERLAY THRESHOLD <nuLimit>

     Sets the threshold size below which code specified to be overlaid will
     be moved back to the root section of the program.

     ^bBLINKER OVERLAY UMB ON | OFF

     Used in conjunction with a suitable XMS driver it allows the Blinker
     overlay manager to execute overlays in upper memory blocks above 640KB.

     ^bBLINKER PROCEDURE DEPTH <nuDepth>

     Specifies maximum depth of CA-Clipper procedure nesting.  This depth is
     the number of procedure calls that are executed before a procedure
     return.

     ^bDEFINE <symbol>[, <symbol> ...]

     Specifies symbols to be excluded at link time and points them to a dummy
     routine in the overlay manager.

     ^bDEFLIB

     Uses default library search records to locate and link libraries which
     are specified within an object module.

     ^bECHO [ON | OFF |] [<cString>]

     ECHO ON <cString> turns on echoing of the script file to the screen,
     with the first line displayed being <cString> if it is specified.  ECHO
     OFF turns off echoing to the screen of the script file and ignores the
     rest of the line.

     ^bENDAREA

     Specifies the end of an overlay area to the linker, as described in the
     BEGINAREA section.

     ^bEXTDICTIONARY

     ^b   [, [d:][path]<libname> ...]

     Specifies one or more program libraries required by the program.

     ^bMAP [=[d:][path]<filename>] [S][,A]

     Requests a segment map of the executable.

     ^bMIXCASE

     Causes Blinker to treat all publics and externals as case sensitive at
     link time, rather than converting them to UPPERCASE.

     ^bMODULE <module> [,<module> ...]
     ^b   [FROM <libname>]

     Specifies placement of individual library modules regardless of whether
     the originating libraries or object modules are specified within an
     overlay area or not.

     ^bMURPHY

     Causes the overlay manager to attempt to force any inadvertent overlay
     errors (programming errors) to manifest themselves during testing or
     debugging.

     ^bNOBELL

     Suppresses the beep upon completion of link.

     filename can optionally include a drive designator and a path reference.
     You can specify a maximum of 16 files in the <makeFile list>.

     ^b<macroDef list>^b is a list (separated by spaces) of one or more macro
     definitions of the form <macroName>=[<value>].  If you specify more than
     one macro definition, separate them with a space.  If you define a macro
     on the command line, you cannot redefine it in the make file without
     first undefining it.  In this way, command line macros take precedence
     over make file macros of the same name.

     ^b<option list>^b is a list of one or more options to control the course
     of the make, all of which are described below.  To get a list of options,
     specify the RMAKE command line with no arguments.

 ^bRMAKE Options^b

     All options are shown in uppercase preceded by a slash (/).  Note,
     however, that options are not case-sensitive and that you can replace
     the slash with a dash (-) if you prefer.

     Some compiler options have arguments.  If an option has arguments,
     specify them after the option, with no space between the option and
     its first argument.

     ^b/B

     Displays debugging information.

     ^b/D<macroName>[:<value>]

     Defines a macro and an optional value.  If the value is not supplied,
     the macro is defined with a null value.

     ^b/F

     Forces RMAKE to perform all actions defined in the make file(s) without
     regard to the date and time stamps of the files in the dependency and
     inference rules.  In other words, the application will be rebuilt,
     regardless of whether any files have been updated since the last build.

     ^b/I

     Ignores execution errors.

     ^b/N

     Performs a null make displaying the commands that would be executed
     without actually executing them.

     ^b/Q

     Suppresses the RMAKE copyright message.

     ^b/U

     Enables the # character as a comment indicator and suppresses its use as
     a directive indicator.

     ^b/W

     Displays certain warning messages.

     ^b/XS<numSymbols>

     Sets the size of the internal symbol table.  If not specified, the
     default is 500 symbols.

     ^b/XW<numBytes>

     Sets the size of the internal workspace.  If not specified, the default
     is 2048 bytes.

 ^bComments^b

     Comments can be specified using C-style inline comments (e.g. /* .. */ )
     or C-style line comments (//) or, if the /U option is used, Unix make-
     style comments (#).  Comments cannot be nested.

 ^bDependency Rules^b

     A dependency rule causes certain actions to be performed if any of the
     dependent files have a newer date and time stamp than the target file:

     ^b<targetFile>: <dependentFile list>
     ^b   [<action>]
     ^b   [<action>]...

 ^bInference Rules^b

     An inference rule is used to complete a dependency rule specified with
     no actions.  It defines the actions to take for any incomplete
     dependency rule that satisfies certain filename extensions:

     ^b.<dependentExtension>.<targetExtension>:
     ^b   [<action>]
     ^b   [<action>]...

 ^bMacro Definitions^b

     Macros are defined in make files using the following syntax:

     ^b<macroName> = [<value>]

     Once defined, a macro can be referred to using the following syntax:

     ^b$(<macroName>)

     To assign the contents of a macro to another macro, use the following
     syntax:

     ^b<macroName> := $(<macroName>)

 ^bMakepath Macros^b

     Makepath macros are special macros that define where RMAKE searches and
     creates classes of files as defined by extension.  Makepath macros are
     defined using the following syntax:

     ^bmakepath[.<extension>] = <pathSpec>

 ^bPredefined Macros^b

     In addition to user-defined macros, there are several predefined macros
     that can be used to access dependency and target filenames.

     ^b$*

     Expands to the target filename without a path or extension.

     ^b$@

     Expands to the target filename, including path and extension.

     ^b$**

     Expands to the complete list of full dependency filenames.

     ^b$<

     Expands to the full name of the first file in the dependent file list.

     ^b$?

     Expands to a list of dependencies that have a more recent date and time
     stamp than the target file.

 ^bDirectives^b

     RMAKE provides directives to control the operation of the make process.
     Directives cannot be used as action lines.  Macros encountered in a
     directive are expanded immediately.  By default, either the # character
     or the ! character can be used to specify a directive. If the /U option
     is used, the # character is interpreted as a comment indicator and
     cannot be used to specify directives.

     ^b#! <action>

     Executes a DOS command.

     ^b#ifdef <macroName>
     ^b   <statements>...
     ^b#else
     ^b   <statements>...
     ^b#endif

     Executes statements between the #ifdef directive and the corresponding
     #else or #endif directives if the specified <macroName> exists.

     ^b#ifeq <word1> <word2>
     ^b   <statements>...
     ^b#else
     ^b   <statements>...
     ^b#endif

     Executes statements between the #ifeq directive and the corresponding
     #else or #endif directives if <word1> and <word2> are identical.  A word
     consists of one or more characters up to the next white space character.
     To include a white space character within a word, enclose the word in
     double quote (") marks.  Note that the comparison is not case-sensitive.

     ^b#iffile <fileSpec>
     ^b   <statements>...
     ^b#else
     ^b   <statements>...
     ^b#endif

     Executes statements between the #iffile directive and the corresponding
     #else or #endif directives if any files match the specified <fileSpec>.

     ^b#ifndef <macroName>
     ^b   <statements>...
     ^b#else
     ^b   <statements>...
     ^b#endif

     Executes statements between the #ifndef directive and the corresponding
     #else or #endif directives if the specified <macroName> does not exist.

     ^b#include "<fileName>"

     Inserts and processes the contents of <fileName> before continuing with
     the current make file.

     ^b#stderr "<text>"

     Writes the <text> to the standard error file or device.

     ^b#stdout "<text>"

     Writes the <text> to the standard output file or device.

     ^b#undef <macroName>

     Removes any previous definition of the specified <macroName>.

'------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 ^bCA-Clipper Debugger--CLD.EXE^b
 Allows you to debug your source code while your executable file is running.
컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

     ^bCLD [[/43 | /50 | /S] [@<scriptFile>]
     ^b   <exeFile> [<argument list>]]

 ^bArguments^b

     If no command line arguments are specified, CLD displays a brief help
     screen.

     ^b/43 | /50 | /S^b specifies the screen mode used by the debugger.  These
     three options are mutually exclusive and, if more than one is specified,
     CLD.EXE uses the last one that occurs on the command line.  The default
     screen mode is 25 lines, with the debugger using the entire screen.

     ^b/43^b specifies 43-line mode and is available on EGA monitors only.

     ^b/50^b specifies 50-line mode and is available on EGA and VGA monitors
     only.

     ^b/S^b is available on EGA and VGA monitors only.  This option splits
     the screen between your application and the debugger, allowing you to
     view the application and the debugger simultaneously.  On a VGA monitor
     /S uses 50-line mode, and on an EGA monitor it uses 43-line mode. In
     split screen mode, the top 25 lines of the screen are used by your
     application, and the remaining lines are used for the debugger display.

     ^b<scriptFile>^b is the name of a script file with a default extension
     of (.cld).  CLD searches for the specified <scriptFile> in the current
     directory then searches the DOS PATH.  A script file is simply an ASCII
     text file containing one or more debugger commands, with each command
     appearing on a separate line.  When the debugger is invoked with a
     script file, each command in the file is executed automatically after
     the <exeFile> file is loaded.

     In addition to any script file called for on the CLD command line, the
     debugger automatically searches for a script file with the name
     Init.cld.  If a file by this name is located in the current directory or
     anywhere in the DOS PATH, the debugger executes it as a script file.  If
     both Init.cld and a command line script file are present, Init.cld is
     executed first followed by the command line script file.

     ^b<exeFile>^b is the name of the executable file (.EXE) you want to
     debug.  CLD searches for the <exeFile> in the current directory only--
     the DOS PATH is not searched.  The file must include line numbers and
     debugging information.

     ^b<argument list>^b is the argument list for <exeFile>.  There must be a
     space between <argument list> and <exeFile>.
