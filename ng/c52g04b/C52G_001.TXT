'------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 ^bCA-Clipper Compiler--(CLIPPER.EXE)^b

 ^bOverview^b

     Compiles one or more program files (.prg) containing procedures and
     user-defined functions to form an object file (.OBJ).

 ^bSyntax^b

     ^bCLIPPER [<sourceFile> | @<scriptFile>
     ^b   [<option list>]]

 ^bCommand Line Arguments^b

     This is the command line syntax to invoke the CA-Clipper compiler.  If
     issued without any arguments, a help screen is displayed.

     ^b<sourceFile>^b is the name of the program file (.prg) to compile to an
     object file.

     ^b<scriptFile>^b is the name of an ASCII text file containing a list of
     source files to compile into a single object file.  The default
     extension for this file is (.CLP).

     ^b<option list>^b is a list of one or more options to control the course
     of the compilation, all of which are described below.

 ^bCompiler Options^b

     ^b/A

     Declares any variable included in a PRIVATE, PUBLIC, or PARAMETERS
     statement as MEMVAR.

     ^b/B

     Includes debugging information in the object file.

     ^b/CREDIT

     Displays the CA-Clipper credits to the console.

     ^b/D<identifier>[=<text>]

     Defines an identifier to the preprocessor with <text> assigned to the
     <identifier> if specified.

     ^b/ES

     Default exit severity level.  If warnings are encountered during
     compilation, does not set DOS errorlevel upon exit.  Compatible with
     CA-Clipper 5.0x.

     ^b/ES0

     Same as above.

     ^b/ES1

     If warnings are encountered during compilation, sets DOS levels upon
     exit.

     ^b/ES2

     If warnings are encountered during compilation, does not generate object
     file (.OBJ) and sets DOS errorlevel upon exit.

     ^b/I<pathName>

     Adds the specified directory to the front of the INCLUDE path list.
     Multiple /I options may be specified in the same compiler session to
     specify several header file search directories.

     ^b/L

     Excludes the program source code line numbers from the object file.

     ^b/M

     Compiles only the current program file (.prg) suppressing automatic
     search for program files (.prg) referenced in a program file with the
     DO, SET FORMAT, and SET PROCEDURE commands.

     ^b/N

     Suppresses the automatic definition of a procedure with the same name as
     the program file (.prg).

     ^b/O<objFile>

     Defines the name and/or location of the output object file.

     ^b/P

     Preprocesses the program file (.prg) and copying the result to an output
     file with a (.ppo) extension.

     ^b/Q

     Suppresses line numbers from displaying while compiling.

     ^b/R[<libFile>]

     Embeds a library search request in the object file.  If /R is specified
     without <libFile> name, the default requests for CLIPPER.LIB,
     EXTEND.LIB, and DBFNTX.LIB are suppressed.  Multiple /R options may be
     specified in the same compiler session to embed more than one library
     request.

     ^b/S

     Checks the syntax of the current (.prg) file and no object file is
     generated.

     ^b/T<pathName>

     Specifies a different directory for temporary files generated during
     compilation.

     ^b/U[<userStandardHeaderFile>]

     Identifies an alternate standard header file to preprocess in place of
     the supplied STD.CH which is used automatically.

     ^b/V

     Forces the compiler to assume all references to undeclared or unaliased
     variable names are public or private variables.

     ^b/W

     Generates warning messages for undeclared or unaliased (ambiguous)
     variable references.

     ^b/Z

     Suppresses shortcutting optimizations on the logical operators .AND. and
     .OR.  This option is provided as an aid to isolating code that depends
     on the behavior of older versions of CA-Clipper.

!short: CA-Clipper Linker               RTLINK.EXE      (command line)              ^r^CE4^r
'------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 ^bCA-Clipper Linker--(RTLINK.EXE)^b

 ^bOverview^b

     Combines object files (.OBJ) with library files (.LIB) to form an
     executable file (.EXE) or prelink library (.PLL).

 ^bSyntax^b

     The default, FREEFORMAT syntax to invoke .RTLink is as follows:

     ^bRTLINK [FILE <objFile list>
     ^b      [OUTPUT <outputFile>]
     ^b      [LIBRARY [<libFile list>]
     ^b      [<linkOption list>]] | [@<scriptFile>]

     The POSITIONAL syntax is:

     ^bRTLINK [<objFile list>,
     ^b      [<outputFile>],
     ^b      [<mapFile>],
     ^b      [<libFile list>]
     ^b      [<linkOption list>]] | [@<scriptFile>][;]

     If used without arguments, .RTLink enters prompt mode in which you are
     prompted for linker input.

 ^bCommand Line Arguments^b

     ^b<objFile list>^b is a list of object files to link.

     ^b<outputFile>^b is the name of the output file to be generated.  If not
     specified, the name of the first file on the .RTLink command line is
     used.

     ^b<mapFile>^b is the name of a map file to generate.

     ^b<libFile list>^b is the list of library files to search in order to
     resolve any undefined symbols.

     ^b<linkOption list>^b refers to the use of one or more of the linker
     options described below.

     ^b<scriptFile>^b is the name of an ASCII text file used as the linker
     script file.  The default extension for this file is (.LNK).

 ^bScript File^b

     Using the FREEFORMAT syntax, options specified in the script file do not
     have to be in a specific order.  However, when using POSITIONAL syntax,
     the format of the script file must be as follows:

     ^b<objFile list>[<linkOption list>]
     ^b   [<outputFile>]
     ^b   [<mapFile>]
     ^b   [<libFile list>]  [;]

 ^bLinker Options^b

     For many options, two syntaxes are given and the correct one depends on
     the input mode used.  Specifying options in POSITIONAL mode requires the
     option to begin with a forward slash (if no forward slash is included in
     the syntax, the option is allowed only in FREEFORMAT). FREEFORMAT mode
     allows you to use either syntax, and where there is only one syntax
     representation it allows you to omit both the slash and the colon.

     ^b/BATCH | /NOBATCH

     BATCH prevents the linker from prompting you when it is unable to locate
     a file.  NOBATCH is the default.

     ^bBEGINAREA
     ^b.
     ^b. <statements>
     ^b.
     ^bENDAREA

     Designates a static overlay area with all sections specified between
     these two commands becoming static overlay sections within the overlay
     area.  Static overlay areas may be nested by specifying a
     BEGINAREA...ENDAREA construct inside of another.

     ^b/DEBUG

     Causes the .RTLink overlay manager to display a message that identifies
     each overlay as it is loaded into memory during program execution.

     ^b/DEFAULTLIBRARYSEARCH | /NODEFAULTLIBRARYSEARCH

     NODEFAULTLIBRARYSEARCH causes .RTLink to ignore any library names
     embedded by the compiler.  DEFAULTLIBRARYSEARCH is the default.

     ^b/DYNAMIC[:<ovlFile>]
     ^bDYNAMIC [INTO <ovlFile>]

     DYNAMIC forces the linker to place any subsequent CA-Clipper-compiled
     modules into a dynamic overlay instead of placing the module in the root
     section.  DYNAMIC is the opposite of RESIDENT and is the default mode.

     ^b/EXCLUDE:<symbol>
     ^bEXCLUDE <symbol list>

     In prelink mode, causes any module defining the specified symbol(s) to
     be excluded from the link.

     ^b/EXTDICTIONARY | /NOEXTDICTIONARY

     /NOEXTDICTIONARY causes the linker not to search the extended
     dictionary.  /EXTDICTIONARY is the default.

     ^b/FREEFORMAT

     Configures the linker interface to FREEFORMAT input mode when .RTLink
     switches to a new input stream. /FREEFORMAT is the opposite of
     /POSITIONAL and the default input mode.

     ^b/HELP

     Lists the linker options to the console.

     ^b/IGNORECASE | /NOIGNORECASE

     NOIGNORECASE causes case to be significant in symbol and segment names.
     IGNORECASE is the default.

     ^b/INCREMENTAL[:<wastedSpace>] | /NOINCREMENTAL

     INCREMENTAL enables incremental linking of CA-Clipper-compiled modules.
     When a program is linked, only modules that have changed are relinked.
     NOINCREMENTAL is the default.

     ^b/MAP[:<mapOption list>]
     ^bMAP [= <mapFile>] [<mapOption list>]

     Generates a map file containing one or more reports about the link
     session.

     ^bMODULE <moduleName list>

     Moves the segments from the specified modules into the current static
     overlay section.

     ^b/PLL:<prelinkLib>

     Used in link mode to specify a prelinked library file the output
     executable file depends on.

     ^b/POSITIONAL

     Configures the linker interface to the POSITIONAL input mode when
     .RTLink switches to a new input stream. /POSITIONAL is the opposite of
     /FREEFORMAT which is the default input mode.

     ^b/PRELINK

     Changes .RTLink to prelink mode.  In this mode the <outputFile>
     generated by .RTLink is a prelink library (.PLL) file instead of an
     executable file (.EXE).

     ^bPRELOAD

     Causes the current static overly section to be loaded into memory before
     the program begins execution.  Normally, only the resident sections of
     the program are loaded into memory before execution begins.

     ^b/REFER:<symbol>
     ^bREFER <symbol list>

     In prelink mode, forces .RTLink to search all specified libraries in
     order to load the necessary code associated with the specified symbols.

     ^b/RESIDENT

     Causes subsequent CA-Clipper-compiled modules to be loaded into the root
     section of the current program, overriding the automatic creation of
     dynamic overlays for all CA-Clipper-compiled code. RESIDENT is the
     opposite of DYNAMIC.

     ^bSECTION [= <sectionName>] [INTO <ovlFile>]

     Creates a static overlay section, and causes segments within any non-
     CA-Clipper object modules specified in subsequent FILE or LIBRARY
     options to become a part of that section.

     ^b/SILENT

     Suppresses the display of the linker prompts and responses when .RTLink
     is invoked with a script file.

     ^b/STACK:<sizeBytes>

     Specifies a program stack overriding the stack size specified in the
     object module.  <sizeBytes> is a numeric values up to 65,535.

     ^b/VERBOSE[:<level>]

     Causes .RTLink to display status messages during linking indicating the
     modules being linked and in what order. <level> specifies the amount of
     information to display (0, 1, or 2).

'------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 ^bProgram Maintenance--(RMAKE.EXE)^b

 ^bOverview^b

     Automates the maintenance of multi-file program systems by keeping files
     up to date.  It does this by comparing the date and time stamps of files
     related to one another and performs a series of actions if the date and
     time stamps do not match.

 ^bSyntax^b

     ^bRMAKE [<makeFile list>]
     ^b   [<macroDef list>] [<option list>]

 ^bCommand Line Arguments^b

     This is the command line syntax to invoke the CA-Clipper make utility.
     If issued without any arguments, a help screen is displayed.

     ^b<makeFile list>^b is a list of one or more make files to process.  The
     default extension for this file is (.RMK).

     ^b<macroDef list>^b is a list of one or more macro definitions of the
     form <macroName>=<value>.

     ^b<option list>^b is a list of one or more options to control the course
     of the make, all of which are described below.

 ^bRMAKE Options^b

     ^b/B

     Displays debugging information.

     ^b/D<macroName>[:<value>]

     Defines a macro and an optional value.  If the value is not supplied,
     the macro is defined with a null value.

     ^b/I

     Ignores execution errors.

     ^b/N

     Performs a null make displaying the commands that would be executed
     without actually executing them.

     ^b/S

     Searches subdirectories for make files.

     ^b/U

     Enables the # character as a comment indicator and suppresses its use as
     a directive indicator.

     ^b/W

     Displays certain warning messages.

     ^b/XS<numSymbols>

     Sets the size of the internal symbol table.  If not specified, the
     default is 500 symbols.

     ^b/XW<numBytes>

     Sets the size of the internal workspace.  If not specified, the default
     is 2048 bytes.

 ^bComments^b

     Comments may be specified using C-style inline comments (e.g. /* .. */ )
     or C-style line comments (//) or, if the /U option is used, Unix make-
     style comments (#).  Comments cannot be nested.

 ^bDependency Rules^b

     A dependency rule causes certain actions to be performed if any of the
     dependent files have a newer date and time stamp than the target file:

     ^b<targetFile>: <dependentFile list>
     ^b   [<action>]
     ^b   [<action>]...

 ^bInference Rules^b

     An inference rule is used to complete a dependency rule specified with
     no actions.  It defines the actions to take for any incomplete
     dependency rule that satisfies certain filename extensions:

     ^b.<dependentExtension>.<targetExtension>:
     ^b   [<action>]
     ^b   [<action>]...

 ^bMacro Definitions^b

     Macros are defined in make files using the following syntax:

     ^b<macroName> = <value>

     Once defined, a macro can be referred to using the following syntax:

     ^b$(<macroName>)

     To assign the contents of a macro to another macro, use the following
     syntax:

     ^b<macroName> := $(<macroName>)

 ^bMakepath Macros^b

     Makepath macros are special macros that define where RMAKE searches and
     creates classes of files as defined by extension.  Makepath macros are
     defined using the following syntax:

     ^bmakepath[.<extension>] = <pathSpec>

 ^bPredefined Macros^b

     In addition to user-defined macros, there are several predefined macros
     that can be used to access dependency and target filenames.

     ^b$*

     Expands to the target filename without a path or extension.

     ^b$@

     Expands to the target filename including path and extension.

     ^b$**

     Expands to the complete list of full dependency filenames.

     ^b$<

     Expands to the full name of the first file in the dependent file list.

     ^b$?

     Expands to a list of dependencies that have a more recent date and time
     stamp than the target file.

 ^bDirectives^b

     RMAKE provides directives to control the operation of the make process.
     Directives cannot be used as action lines.  Macros encountered in a
     directive are expanded immediately.  By default, either the # character
     or the ! character can be used to specify a directive. If the /U option
     is used, the # character is interpreted as a comment indicator, and
     cannot be used to specify directives.

     ^b#! <action>

     Execute a DOS command.

     ^b#else

     Executes statements between the #else and the next #endif directive when
     the corresponding #if directive evaluates to false (.F.).

     ^b#end[if]

     Terminates the block of statements defined by a #if directive.

     ^b#ifdef <macroName>

     Executes statements between the #ifdef directive and the corresponding
     #else or #endif directives if the specified <macroName> exists.

     ^b#ifeq <word1> <word2>

     Executes statements between the #ifeq directive and the corresponding
     #else or #endif directives if <word1> and <word2> are identical.  A word
     consists of one or more characters up to the next white space character.
     To include a white space character within a word, enclose the word in
     double-quote (") marks.

     ^b#iffile <fileSpec>

     Executes statements between the #iffile directive and the corresponding
     #else or #endif directives if any files match the specified <fileSpec>.

     ^b#ifndef <macroName>

     Executes statements between the #ifndef directive and the corresponding
     #else or #endif directives if the specified <macroName> does not exist.

     ^b#include “<fileName>“

     Inserts and processes the contents of <fileName> before continuing with
     the current make file.

     ^b#stderr "<text>"

     Writes the <text> to the standard error file or device.

     ^b#stdout "<text>"

     Writes the <text> to the standard output file or device.

     ^b#undef <macroName>

'------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 ^bCA-Clipper Program Editor--(PE.EXE)^b

 ^bOverview^b

     Creates and edits simple program files.

 ^bSyntax^b

     ^bPE [<filename>]^b

 ^bCommand Line Arguments^b

     ^B<filename>^B is the name of the text file to edit or create.  The
     default extension is (.prg).  If a filename is not specified, PE
     prompts you for one.

 ^bSystem Architecture^b

     Like the DBU and RL utilities, PE is written in CA-Clipper and
     provided in source code form.  If you installed CA-Clipper using the
     default configuration, a single source file named Pe.prg is located
     in the \CLIPPER5\SOURCE\PE directory.  PE.EXE is installed in
     \CLIPPER5\BIN and this directory is included in the PATH statement in
     your AUTOEXEC.BAT.  You should, therefore, be able to access PE from
     any drive and/or directory.

     To facilitate maintenance of the PE program file, the make file,
     PE.RMK, is also installed in the PE source directory.  Provided you
     do not add new source files or make changes in the existing file
     dependencies, issuing the following command at the DOS prompt:

     C>RMAKE PE

     will compile and link the PE source files to create a new PE.EXE
     executable file.  See the Program Maintenance--RMAKE.EXE chapter in
     Programming and Utilties guide for more information about make files.

 ^bDatabase Utility--(DBU.EXE)^b

 ^bOverview^b

     Creates and modifies database structures; performs simple data
     management tasks.

 ^bSyntax^b

     ^bDBU [/<colorString>] [<filename>] /e^b

 ^bCommand Line Arguments^b

     This is the command line syntax to invoke the CA-Clipper database
     utility.  If issued without any arguments, the main DBU screen is
     displayed from which you can open files and access the menu bar.

     ^B<colorString>^B is /C for color and /M for monochrome.

     ^B<filename>^B is the name of a view file (.vew) previously created in
     DBU or a database file (.dbf).  Specifying this argument causes DBU to
     open and browse the specified file.

     Specifying ^b<filename>^b on the DBU command line causes the named file
     to be opened and browsed after DBU is loaded.

     ^B/e^B opens the file EXCLUSIVE.  This parameter is case-insensitive.

 ^bSystem Architecture^b

     DBU is an application that is written entirely in CA-Clipper.  If you
     installed the default configuration of the development environment, the
     source code is located in the \CLIPPER5\SOURCE\DBU directory on the
     disk where CA-Clipper is installed.   DBU.EXE and DBU.HLP are
     installed in \CLIPPER5\BIN and this directory is included in the PATH
     statement in your AUTOEXEC.BAT.  You should, therefore, be able to
     access DBU from any drive and/or directory.

     The source files needed that make up the DBU system are:

     ^B^CFE^B  Dbu.prg
     ^B^CFE^B  Dbu.hlp
     ^B^CFE^B  Dbucopy.prg
     ^B^CFE^B  Dbuedit.prg
     ^B^CFE^B  Dbuhelp.prg
     ^B^CFE^B  Dbuindx.prg
     ^B^CFE^B  Dbunet.prg
     ^B^CFE^B  Dbustru.prg
     ^B^CFE^B  Dbuutil.prg
     ^B^CFE^B  Dbuview.prg

     The system is provided as source code so you can modify it to suit your
     specific needs.  You may want to make enhancements specific to your
     development environment or add the DBU system to your application
     thereby giving your users the power to create their own views.

     If you decide to tailor this system by making changes to the source
     code, a make file called DBU.RMK is located in the same directory as
     the DBU source code.  Provided that your changes do not involve
     additional source modules or changes in the existing file dependencies,
     issuing the following command at the DOS prompt:

     C>RMAKE DBU

     will compile and link the system to create a new DBU.EXE file.  Refer
     to the Program Maintenance--RMAKE.EXE chapter in the Programming and
     Utiltites guide for more information on make files.

 ^bReport and Label Utility--(RL.EXE)^b

 ^bOverview^b

     Creates and modifies report (.frm) and label (.lbl) files.

 ^bSyntax^b

     ^bRL^b

 ^bSystem Architecture^b

     The RL system is written in CA-Clipper.  If you installed the default
     configuration of the development environment, the source code is
     located in the \CLIPPER5\SOURCE\RL directory on the disk where
     CA-Clipper is installed.   RL.EXE is installed in \CLIPPER5\BIN and
     this directory is included in the PATH statement in your AUTOEXEC.BAT.
     You should, therefore, be able to access RL from any drive and/or
     directory.

     The source files needed that make up the RL system are:

     ^B^CFE^B  Rlfront.prg
     ^B^CFE^B  Rllack.prg
     ^B^CFE^B  Rldialg.prg

     The system is provided as source code so you can modify it to suit
     your specific needs.  You may want to make enhancements specific to
     your development environment or simply add the RL system to your
     application thereby giving your users the power to create their own
     reports and labels.

     To facilitate modification, the RL system is broken up into two
     primary subsystems: front and back.  The RL front subsystem (found in
     Rlfront.prg) is the user interface of the entire RL system.  The back
     subsystem (found in Rlback.prg) contains all of the routines for
     reading and writing (.frm) and (.lbl) files.  The system is organized
     in this way so that you can create your own user interface and easily
     access the lower-level routines to read and write the form files.

     If you decide to tailor this system by making changes to the source
     code, a make file, RL.RMK, is located in the same directory as the RL
     source code.  Provided that your changes do not involve additional
     source modules or changes in the existing file dependencies, issuing
     the following command at the DOS prompt:

     C>RMAKE RL

     will compile and link the system to create a new RL.EXE file.  Refer
     to the Program Maintenance--RMAKE.EXE chapter in the Programming and
     Utilities guide for more information.

!short: CA-Clipper Debugger             CLD.EXE         (menu)                      ^r^CE4^r

 ^bThe CA-Clipper Debugger--(CLD.EXE)^b

 ^bOverview^b

     Allows you to debug your source code while your executable file is
     running.

 ^bSyntax^b

     ^bCLD [[/43 | /50 | /S] [@<scriptFile>]
     ^b   <exeFile> [<argument list>]]

 ^bCommand Line Arguments^b

     This is the command line syntax to invoke the Debugger.  If issued
     without any arguments, a brief help screen is displayed.

     ^b/43^b specifies 43 line mode and is available on EGA and VGA monitors.

     ^b/50^b specifies 50 line mode and is available on VGA monitors only.

     ^b/S^b is available on EGA and VGA monitors only.  This option splits
     the screen between your application and the Debugger, allowing you to
     view the application and the Debugger simultaneously.  On a VGA monitor
     /S uses 50 line mode, and on an EGA monitor it uses 43 line mode. In
     split screen mode, the top 25 lines of the screen are used by your
     application, and the remaining lines are used for the Debugger display.

     ^b<scriptFile>^b is the name of a script file with a default extension
     of (.cld).  CLD searches for the specified <scriptFile> in the current
     directory and then searches the DOS PATH.  A script file is simply an
     ASCII text file containing one or more Debugger commands, with each
     command appearing on a separate line.  When the Debugger is invoked with
     a script file, each command in the file is executed automatically after
     the <exeFile> file is loaded.

     In addition to any script file called for on the CLD command line, the
     Debugger automatically searches for a script file with the name
     Init.cld.  If a file by this name is located in the current directory or
     anywhere in the DOS PATH, the Debugger executes it as a script file.  If
     both Init.cld and a command line script file are present, Init.cld is
     executed first followed by the command line script file.

     ^b<exeFile>^b is the name of the executable file (.EXE) you want to
     debug.  CLD searches for the <exeFile> in the current directory only--
     the DOS PATH is not searched.  If this file has not been compiled using
     the /B compiler option to embed debugging information, debugging is not
     possible.

     ^b<argument list>^b is the argument list for <exeFile>.  There must be a
     space between <argument list> and <exeFile>.
