 ^bOld style PUBLICs vs. new functions

 In SuperLibs previous to 3.0, a scheme of PUBLIC
 variables was used to represent certain global SuperLib
 environment settings. To avoid PUBLICs, a new set of functions
 exists to set and retrieve these previously PUBLIC variables.

 All of the functions are of the SET/RETRIEVE type. In
 other words, they will always return the current setting, but
 you can also pass them a new setting as a parameter. For
 example, previously the normal color setting was done via the
 PUBLIC variable C_NORMCOL and was accessed like so:

         SETCOLOR(c_normcol)             // retrieve
         c_normcol = "W/N,N/W,,+W/N"     // set new

 Where now it would be:

         SETCOLOR( sls_normcol()  )      // retrieve
         sls_normcol("W/N,N/W,,+W/N")    // set new

 Here is a comparison of the old PUBLICs versus the
 new functions:

 OLD PUBLIC   FUNCTION        MEANING
 C_NORMCOL    sls_normcol()   Normal colors
 C_NORMMENU   sls_normmenu()  Normal colors - menu
