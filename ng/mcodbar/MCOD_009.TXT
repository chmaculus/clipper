This library would'nt be possible without the help of some of my
friends wich I want to thank :

 - Ignacio de Haro. We started together to decodify barcodes structure
   "by eye", without information of any type. Thanks to him, and
   thanks to my enterprise ROTEDIC,S.A. were I did the coding.

 - Guillermo E.Erdei, wich wrote the only book I've seen on
   Barcodes and wich sended to me the structure of the UNIFORM CODE
   COUNCIL INC. UCC-128. I'used the book to code EAN barcodes.

 - Jose Luis of Mecco, wich brought me the description of Datalogic
   barcodes.
