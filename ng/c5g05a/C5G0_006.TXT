     .RTLink produces overlays containing compiled program code.  By
     default, all compiled Clipper code is placed in dynamic overlays.
     Additionally, static overlaying may be requested for C or Assembler
     code.

     By default, overlays are appended to the end of the application's
     .EXE file (the code may be written to a separate overlay file by
     using the INTO clause in the overlaying directive).  During
     execution, the runtime system opens the .EXE file and reads
     overlays as required.

     When the runtime system needs to read overlays, it opens the .EXE
     file for shared, read-only access.  On a network, this allows
     multiple processes to read the file at the same time.

     On some networks, however, a problem can arise if an attempt is
     made to run the .EXE when another process has opened it to read
     overlays.  The error occurs because the DOS EXEC function (used by
     COMMAND.COM to execute programs) opens .EXE files using a sharing
     mode called "compatibility mode."  On some networks, this causes a
     sharing violation if the file is already in use by another process,
     even if the other process has specified that it wishes to share the
     file.

     If this conflict occurs, it can usually be resolved by marking the
     affected file read-only on the disk.  A small utility program,
     RO.COM, is supplied for this purpose.  RO toggles the read-only
     status of a specified file.
