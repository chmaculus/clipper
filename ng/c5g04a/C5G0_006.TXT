 ^bSyntax^b

     ^bPE [<filename>]^b

 ^bCommand-line Arguments^b

     ^B<filename>^B is the name of the text file to edit or create.  The
     default extension is (.prg).  If a filename is not specified, PE
     prompts you for one.

 ^bSystem Architecture^b

     Like the DBU and RL utilities, PE is written in Clipper and provided in
     source code form.  If you installed Clipper 5.0 using the default
     configuration, a single source file named Pe.prg is located in the
     \CLIPPER5\SOURCE\PE directory.  PE.EXE is installed in \CLIPPER5\BIN
     and this directory is included in the PATH statement in your
     AUTOEXEC.BAT.  You should, therefore, be able to access PE from any
     drive and/or directory.

     To facilitate maintenance of the PE program file, the make file,
     PE.RMK, is also installed in the PE source directory.  Provided you do
     not add new source files or make changes in the existing file
     dependencies, issuing the following command at the DOS prompt:

     C>RMAKE PE

     will compile and link the PE source files to create a new PE.EXE
     executable file.  See the Program Maintenance--RMAKE.EXE chapter in
     Programming and Utilties book for more information about make files.
