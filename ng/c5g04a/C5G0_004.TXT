 ^bSyntax^b

     ^b^CFE^B  The default, FREEFORMAT syntax to invoke .RTLink is as follows:

        ^bRTLINK [FILE <objFile list>^b
           ^b[OUTPUT <outputFile>]^b
           ^b[LIBRARY [<libFile list>]^b
           ^b[<linkOption list>]]  |  [@<scriptFile>]^b

     ^b^CFE^B  The POSITIONAL syntax is:

        ^bRTLINK [<objFile list>,^b
           ^b[<outputFile>],^b
           ^b[<mapFile>],^b
           ^b[<libFile list>]^b
           ^b[<linkOption list>]]  |  [@<scriptFile>][;]^b

     If used without arguments, .RTLink enters prompt mode in which
     you are prompted for linker input.

 ^bCommand-line Arguments^b

     ^B<objFile list>^B is a list of object files to link.

     ^B<outputFile>^B is the name of the output file to be generated.  If
     not specified, the name of the first file on the .RTLink command-line
     is used.

     ^B<mapFile>^B is the name of a map file to generate.

     ^B<libFile list>^B is the list of library files to search in order to
     resolve any undefined symbols.

     ^B<linkOption list>^B refers to the use of one or more of the linker
     options described below.

     ^B<scriptFile>^B is the name of an ASCII text file used as the linker
     script file.

 ^bScript File^b

     Using the FREEFORMAT syntax, options specified in the script file do
     not have to be in a specific order.  However, when using POSITIONAL
     syntax, the format of the script file must be as follows:

     ^b<objFile list>[<linkOption list>]^b
     ^b[<outputFile>]^b
     ^b[<mapFile>]^b
     ^b[<libFile list>]^b

 ^bLinker Options^b

     For many options, two syntaxes are given and the correct one depends on
     the input mode used.  Specifying options in POSITIONAL mode requires
     the option to begin with a forward slash (if no forward slash is
     included in the syntax, the option is allowed only in FREEFORMAT).
     FREEFORMAT mode allows you to use either syntax, and where there is
     only one syntax representation it allows you to omit both the slash and
     the colon.

     ^b/BATCH  |  /NOBATCH^b

     BATCH prevents the linker from prompting you when it is unable to
     locate a file.  NOBATCH is the default.

     ^bBEGINAREA^b
     ^b.^b
     ^b. <linker freeformat options>^b
     ^b.^b
     ^bENDAREA^b

     Designates a static overlay area with all sections specified between
     these two commands becoming static overlay sections within the overlay
     area.  Static overlay areas may be nested by specifying a
     BEGINAREA...ENDAREA construct inside of another.

     ^b/DEBUG^b

     Causes the .RTLink overlay manager to display a message that identifies
     each overlay as it is loaded into memory during program execution.

     ^b/DEFAULTLIBRARYSEARCH  |  /NODEFAULTLIBRARYSEARCH^b

     NODEFAULTLIBRARYSEARCH causes .RTLink to ignore any library names
     embedded by the compiler.  DEFAULTLIBRARYSEARCH is the default.

     ^b/DYNAMIC[:<ovlFile>]^b
     ^bDYNAMIC [INTO <ovlFile>]^b

     DYNAMIC forces the linker to place any subsequent Clipper-compiled
     modules into a dynamic overlay instead of placing the module in the
     root section.  DYNAMIC is the opposite of RESIDENT and is the default
     mode.

     ^b/EXCLUDE:<symbol>^b
     ^bEXCLUDE <symbol list>^b

     In pre-link mode, causes any module defining the specified symbol(s) to
     be excluded from the link.

     ^b/EXTDICTIONARY  |  /NOEXTDICTIONARY^b

     /NOEXTDICTIONARY causes the linker not to search the extended
     dictionary.  /EXTDICTIONARY is the default.

     ^b/FREEFORMAT^b

     Configures the linker interface to FREEFORMAT input mode when .RTLink
     switches to a new input stream.  /FREEFORMAT is the opposite of
     /POSITIONAL and the default input mode.

     ^b/HELP^b

     Lists the linker options to the console.

     ^b/IGNORECASE  |  /NOIGNORECASE^b

     NOIGNORECASE causes case to be significant in symbol and segment
     names.  IGNORECASE is the default.

     ^b/INCREMENTAL[:<wastedSpace>]  |  /NOINCREMENTAL^b

     INCREMENTAL enables incremental linking of Clipper-compiled modules.
     When a program is linked, only modules that have changed are
     re-linked.  NOINCREMENTAL is the default.

     ^b/MAP[:<mapOption list>]^b
     ^bMAP [= <mapFile>] [<mapOption list>]^b

     Generates a map file containing one or more reports about the link
     session.  The available map options are S, N, and A.

     ^bMODULE <moduleName list>^b

     Moves the segments from the specified modules into the current static
     overlay section.

     ^b/PLL:<prelinkLib>^b

     Used in link mode to specify a pre-linked library file the output
     executable file depends on.

     ^b/POSITIONAL^b

     Configures the linker interface to the POSITIONAL input mode when
     .RTLink switches to a new input stream.  /POSITIONAL is the opposite of
     /FREEFORMAT which is the default input mode.

     ^b/PRELINK^b

     Changes .RTLink to pre-link mode.  In this mode the <outputFile>
     generated by .RTLink is a pre-link library (.PLL) file instead of an
     executable (.EXE) file.

     ^bPRELOAD^b

     Causes the current static overly section to be loaded into memory
     before the program begins execution.  Normally, only the resident
     sections of the program are loaded into memory before execution begins.

     ^b/REFER:<symbol>^b
     ^bREFER <symbol list>^b

     In pre-link mode, forces .RTLink to search all specified libraries
     in order to load the necessary code associated with the specified
     symbols.

     ^b/RESIDENT^b

     Causes subsequent Clipper-compiled modules to be loaded into the root
     section of the current program, overriding the automatic creation of
     dynamic overlays for all Clipper-compiled code.  RESIDENT is the
     opposite of DYNAMIC.

     ^bSECTION [= <sectionName>] [INTO <ovlFile>]^b

     Creates a static overlay section, and causes segments within any
     non-Clipper object modules specified in subsequent FILE or LIBRARY
     options to become a part of that section.

     ^b/SILENT^b

     Suppresses the display of the linker prompts and responses when .RTLink
     is invoked with a script file.

     ^b/STACK:<sizeBytes>^b

     Specifies a program stack overriding the stack size specified in the
     object module.  <sizeBytes> is a numeric values up to 65,535.

     ^b/VERBOSE[:<level>]^b

     Causes .RTLink to display status messages during linking indicating the
     modules being linked and in what order.  <level> specifies the amount
     of information to display (0, 1, or 2).
