 ^bSyntax^b

     ^bCLD [[/43 | /50 | /S] [@<scriptFile>]<R>
        ^b<exeFile> [<argument list>]]

 ^bCommand-line Arguments^b

     This is the command-line syntax for invoking the Debugger.  Note that
     with the exception of argument list, all other CLD arguments must come
     before the executable filename on the command-line.  If no command-line
     arguments are specified, CLD displays a brief help screen.

     ^b/43 | /50 | /S^b specifies the screen mode used by the Debugger.
     These three options are mutually exclusive and, if more than one is
     specified, CLD.EXE uses the last one that occurs on the command-line.
     The default screen mode is 25 lines, with the Debugger using the entire
     screen.

     ^b/43^b specifies 43 line mode (available on EGA monitors only).

     ^b/50^b specifies 50 line mode (available on EGA and VGA monitors
     only).

     ^b/S^b (available on EGA and VGA monitors only) splits the screen
     between your application and the Debugger, allowing you to view the
     application and the Debugger simultaneously.  On a VGA monitor /S uses
     50 line mode, and on an EGA monitor it uses 43 line mode.  In split
     screen mode, the top 25 lines of the screen are used by your
     application, and the remaining lines are used for the Debugger
     display.  In this mode, you cannot move or size windows in the
     Debugger.

     ^b<scriptFile>^b is the name of a script file with a default extension
     of (.cld).  CLD searches for the specified <scriptFile> in the current
     directory and then searches the DOS PATH.

     A script file is simply an ASCII text file containing one or more
     Debugger commands, with each command appearing on a separate line.
     When the Debugger is invoked with a script file, each command in the
     file is executed automatically after the <exeFile> file is loaded.

     In addition to any script file called for on the CLD command-line, the
     Debugger automatically searches for a script file with the name
     ^bInit.cld^b.  If a file by this name is located in the current
     directory or anywhere in the DOS PATH, the Debugger executes it as a
     script file.  If both ^bInit.cld^b and a command-line script file are
     present, ^bInit.cld^b is executed first, followed by the command-line
     script file.

     ^b<exeFile>^b is the name of the executable (.EXE) file you want to
     debug.  CLD searches for the <exeFile> in the current directory
     only--the DOS PATH is not searched.  If this file has not been compiled
     using the /B compiler option to embed debugging information, debugging
     is not possible.

     ^b<argument list>^b is the argument list for <exeFile>.

 ^bDescription^b

     The Clipper debugger (CLD.EXE) allows you to view your source code
     while your program is running.  Features of the debugger include
     watching the values of variables and expressions as your program
     executes, examining database (.dbf) files and executing your program
     slowly, a line at a time.
